If you want to do research it's super easy to meet with professors (aside from a select few) and get started here, even as a freshman. We have a lounge with free coffee/printing. \n\nHowever, I will admit there is little to no help given by the department when it comes to providing internships/job opportunities. This is slightly due to faculty's preference for students to work in their labs over the summer instead, but it's mostly because they don't really care what underclassmen do.

I took a few of these courses (Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, etc.) and really unless you are super into math it's just not a good time. The Applied Math department seems to strike a better balance and people are more fun. Additionally, I think employers prefer the Applied Math / Statistics over Pure Math, but that's just a minor point.

If you're talking about jobs that require much of the specialized technical skills you'd get with an engineering degree, then it's a legitimate concern. But if you could also see yourself in jobs that don't strictly require engineering degrees (e.g., finance, consulting), then BME is perfectly fine; they'd just be looking for analytical and problem solving skills and comfort with quantitative stuff. \n\nThe benefit of BME is that you CAN do premed and still have good degree to fallback on. Because BME overlaps significantly more with premed requirements than other engineering degrees like EE or MechE. But at the same time, engineering degrees in general (including BME), have better job prospects than science majors. For the type of jobs where other engineering majors have an advantage over BME, a BME degree would still have an advantage over science majors like neuro / bio. \n\nSo going back to your concern, it's legitimate for certain career paths. But if you want both premed and engineering, BME is probably the best option. I can't say to what extent being BME makes it to maintain a top GPA for med school; my opinion would be it's much more difficult to maintain a top GPA. But for what it's worth all my BME friends ended up going to very good medical schools or didn't have much trouble finding jobs (to my knowledge). Part of this may be because BME at Hopkins is such a competitive program that it is generally comprised of very driven people with a certain tenacity.""",hungryhungryhippooo,86z7y
2shup,b'Concerned about BME job prospects',60wr4d,1490243795,dfa059w,"b""I'm currently a student here. Your concerns are certainly very real. I have had friends that were BME/premed going in, and all of them have dropped one or the other. I'm not saying both can't be done, because I'm sure it certainly has, but you're right, especially at a school like Hopkins where GPA is hard to maintain regardless of your major, having a competitive premed GPA while also majoring BME is difficult. \n\nI would add that a lot of students come to this school with premed aspirations, but find out that it just isn't for them. This doesn't mean they weren't able to do it, but rather that they found a different path that interested them more. My greatest advice would be to look into the requirements for graduating BME and for getting into med school, then give it a semester or two. If you are on track for both, then great! But if not, then take the time to reevaluate your priorities.\n\nAs for your question about the usefulness of a BME degree, I am not in the engineering school so my knowledge may be limited, however I have had 2 of my BME friends describe the BME learning experience as becoming a jack of all trades and master of none. They said to really get involved in BME you'd need to pursue it at the Masters or Doctoral level. One of those two friends recently dropped BME and switched to EE because he felt like he wasn't learning any focused skills. Once again, this is just word of mouth from my 2 friends, so I doubt it translates to all BMEs at this school. Congrats on getting accepted into the program. Although I'm speaking from inexperience, most of my engineering friends that have graduated told me that your job prospects mainly depend on how well you market your skills, how far you network yourself, and what internships you land. \n\nI hope these answers help.

Basically the program changed a lot between my year and the year after me.\n\nWhen I joined you were required to do a thesis, everyone was funded and paid for, and the program took 2 years.  However, the fund that paid the Masters students ran out after my year so there is no more funding available.\n\nThe lack of funding for Masters is really standard across the US though.  Its very rare to be funded unless you go for a PhD.  If you want to talk about paying for it you are best asking a student in the year after me since I didn't pay for it myself.  But I think they did it like every other masters student: just get a student loan from a bank somewhere.\n\nAs for the classes, in my year we didn't take any classes to bring us up to speed.  My background was in mechanical engineering so I need a lot of help with biology stuff, but there were other masters students with backgrounds in biology who helped me.  And in turn I helped them with things like MATLAB and computer stuff.\n\nSo yeah, there is no prerequisite courses required if you are Masters student and you don't have time to take undergrad courses anyway.  Only courses above a certain level count towards the Masters degree requirement and there is a lot of courses to take in a year so you will be booked.\n\nSo yeah you will need to find friends to help with courses and you will need to find a loan to pay.  Although potentially there is some scholarships I'm not aware of (talk to someone the year ahead of you).\n\nBut in the end this is kind of the situation everywhere.  If you manage to find another Masters program that will pay you while you attend, you may want to seriously consider it, but Hopkins is a great school so I imagine it will still be worth it.\n\nHope that helps""",FreeRunningEngineer,eh5fq
2shup,b'Accepted for grad school - some questions',5z1hnu,1489402974,deutn5l,"b'I\'m studying ECE as a master\'s student this year and I did BME undergrad at Hopkins, so I know a handful of students who entered the BME MSE program this past fall; I\'ll do my best to answer, but I honestly don\'t know much about the funding situation.\n\nAs far as I know, most students don\'t need to take any extra classes that are typical \'prerequisites\' when they start. You\'re required to take two ""Systems Bioengineering"" (SBE) Courses (there are three available) regardless of the degree type that you go for. I took all three as an undergrad and I would say there aren\'t any prerequisites per se, but they all required use of MATLAB at some point, and I believe it\'s assumed that you have taken the basic math courses (Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Multivariable Calculus). I\'m not sure if you\'ve taken those, but I wouldn\'t be *too* worried if you hadn\'t. You\'ll have friends and you could catch up on the specific tools on your own time. SBE I and II are more related, and SBE III is its own thing entirely.\n\nThe rest of your courses just need to be 400 level or above (i.e. \'graduate\' level classes) and you\'ll likely have quite a lot of flexibility there. Even if you don\'t have a prerequisite for a certain class, if you\'re a graduate student especially, most professors will let you in regardless (not that that is a guarantee and I\'m sure there are some students who don\'t have that experience, but I\'ve never had any problems just emailing professors, explaining that I don\'t have the prereq, and being allowed in anyway). That said, it does depend a bit on the specific class, your background, and how much time you\'ll have to dedicate to it (if you are missing prereqs). Like if you try to jump into a 600 level CS class without any programming experience (for a computational biology concentration)...that\'ll likely be a struggle.\n\nPersonally, I think the master\'s is very doable in 3 semesters (I and a couple friends are completing ours in 2 semesters), which means that may be a little less money (not much...but still). I\'m not sure about BME MSE, but you can maybe ask about how part-time would work if you want to try to finish in two semesters, but you may have one or two courses left (so you basically pay per credit in the final semester, which could save you quite a bit of money). I know it\'s possible for ECE because I know someone doing that, but again, you\'ll want to ask the BME department.\n\nThere is a chance, if you get really involved in a lab and a project, that you could get some funding from the lab or a project grant, but that\'s a very big maybe (I have been paid a bit from a grant, but that\'s small fry compared to tuition), so I wanted to throw that out there, but I definitely wouldn\'t count on it. Honestly, I\'m not sure what else to say for staying afloat and not drowning in debt for grad school...the majority of people I know either are in debt, have their parents pay for it, or they worked for a couple years and saved up before going to grad school.\n\nSorry that was so long, but I hope it helped a bit.

I lived in the Varsity as an undergrad and that was a complete waste of money (tiny rooms, meh amenities, small kitchens, weird furniture, super overpriced, etc), and I've heard/seen that Nine East 33rd isn't that much better (though I admit I am very jealous of the location). \n\nI lived in the Guilford (note that it is different from Guilford Manor, which is just a block away) for a year and it was pretty nice, though it was a decently long way to walk. Pretty spacious rooms, usually large kitchens, etc. The downsides were that the AC units would only be able to be either hot or cold (the apartment building as a whole would switch at around the season change), and there's generally no laundry unit in the apartment (I might just be spoiled by the fact that I had one in the room for so long).\n\nHopkins House - I know quite a few people who have lived there, including professors and grad students. Honestly...I would avoid it, based on what I've heard. It's also, imo, quite far from campus in terms of walking (~25+ minutes walking, which would lead to...like more than an hour of walking around every day if you go back and forth more than once).\n\nUniOne - Have a handful of friends who live here, and they generally like it!  I've been to a couple apartments there, and they seem pretty spacious and nice, but the downside is that I think it really depends on who actually owns the apartment. I think it's really walkable too.\n\nMarylander - Another place I've been to tons and had friends who lived there last year. Okay apartment space, but they mostly hated the apartment because of the management and annoying things...like apparently they'll sometimes just tell you they're turning off water access for the majority of the day so you can't shower or use the toilet or anything? Maybe someone else who actually lived there can confirm, but I would personally avoid.\n\nI've never lived in a rowhome, but I have friends who spent a few years there and it's apparently very affordable and spacious, but could be more of a hassle (I think the appeal of a lot of apartments are that they kind of 'take care' of everything for you). In terms of location, I personally love Hampden, but I think it's a bit of a longer walk to campus (not too bad though). There's also the Ambassador Apartments, which I've heard is nice.

Sure you have to share a bathroom, but I'm a senior now and live in a rowhouse with people from my AMR house. All of us were random roommates. I did not end up being good friends with the person I lived in a room with, but I did love my hall. We picked up friends along the way but by and large our freshman hallway is the locus of my friend group. Folks who lived in Wolman, McCoy, or Buildings A and B (I think they call them AMR III now) didn't get that and I think they really missed out. My order would be AMR II = AMR I > Wolman > McCoy > Buildings A and B. It is certainly possible to have a sociable floor in Wolman, but I think both the ceiling of sociability is lower and the floor higher than in the AMRs. I lived in McCoy sophomore year and didn't really like it very much. I still had to share a room and the kitchens were tiny and crappy. """,GrimTuesday,none
2shup,b'Freshman Housing Questions',5rhhvf,1486030312,dd7usmd,"b'strukbylightnin answered how the process works so ill just give more insight into each dorm\n\nAMR 1 and 2 are the traditional college dorm experience. Share a room with a roommate, share a bathroom with your floor. My friends that live here only complain about no AC in the first few weeks of school. Good things: you\'ll get the ""social"" aspect where people leave their doors open and people hang out in the hallways and you know people on your floor and interact with them. You\'re also very close to your classes, FFC (the main cafeteria), the rec center, etc. Cons: when I went on a tour here my tour guide\'s bathroom was on a different floor than his and that totally turned me off lol also I needed to have my own bathroom so if that\'s you don\'t go for it. Only good thing about their bathrooms is that they are cleaned for you. \n\nMcCoy and Wolman are pretty much the same except Wolman is a little newer. I live in McCoy. Suite style living with two rooms of two roomates with a shared kitchenette and bathroom. Pros: AC, your own bathroom, have a fridge and extra sink, you can cook basic stuff and have room to buy a microwave if you\'d like. Close to Charles Street Market (CharMar) where you can go for groceries or food in the morning. McCoy and Wolman also have amenities like a study room, gym, larger kitchen, and TV rooms/lounges. Wolman even has a movie theater in it although its hard to reserve. Cons: unless you have a floor where everyone particularly gets along you wont really have people hanging out in your common room or socializing like in AMR 1 and 2, people mostly keep to themselves. Personally my roommate and I are great friends so I really got lucky in that not really talking to people on my floor doesnt matter to me. I have a friend in Wolman whose floor always hangs out together and they go to movies with their RA and stuff but again I think it really depends on the people you live near if you\'re in McCoy or Wolman, whereas its much easier to facilitate being friends with your floormates in AMR1 and 2. The walk to campus in the mornings can also be a pain in the ass but you might as well get used to it as after freshman year you\'ll always have to cross the street to get to campus. It\'s only like 2-3 minutes anyways. You also have to clean your own bathroom, but my roomate and suitemates decided how we\'d divide tasks up so it actually stays clean and we do our dishes right after using them so its a great situation and i\'m quite happy in McCoy. I live on the terrace floor of McCoy (ground floor) which means no stairs, my room is a short walk from the entrance, and my laundry room is right across the hall from my room so I dont have to make a trip to do it and I can just go back to my room and do homework while its running instead of going up and down stairs/elevator to check on it. \n\nAMR 3 is like a ""best of both worlds"" type of situation. Right above the FFC, they have air conditioning, and the building is close to the rec center basically so they are in a great spot for getting everywhere, you have the roomate + 2 suitemate setup Wolman and McCoy have, minus the kitchenette. You have to clean your own bathroom in AMR3. However, this dorm doesn\'t have the amenities that Wolman and Mccoy have, and they only have one common room in their basement with a shitty TV and some couches. My friends there love the proximity of their living situation to everything around campus but sometimes wish they had the TV rooms and amenities of Wolman and McCoy as well as the social aspect of AMR 1 and 2. \n\nSo personally i\'d rank them Wolman, McCoy (Wolman is like a more modern version of McCoy) AMR3, AMR 2/1 mostly because I wanted my own bathroom and a suite and was willing to clean my own stuff. \n\nI would very much encourage you to look for a roommate. I really wouldn\'t advise going in random, as I have some friends that never really talk to their roommate/dislike them. The GroupMes you form over the summer/right now with other 2021 students are a great place to find someone you might be compatible with, that\'s how I found my roomate (in a smaller group of like 15 kids, not the huge one with everyone in it). I was looking for someone my age (I was 19 going into freshman year) with similar mindsets on partying, studying, and future plans. People that say ""I want to go in blind to be surprised"" or something are honestly not making a smart choice, because you don\'t really ""know"" this person but you have an idea of their compatibility, so I\'d really start thinking what kind of person you want to have similar values with and find that person or at least someone close to that. I\'m sure there are facebook groups with male/female roommate searches in addition to the My.jhu portal (at least there were last year) so i\'d start thinking about that. I did all of the things I\'m advising you to do and my roommate is my best friend here so it works out. \n\nAnother note about MEAL PLANS: As a freshman, you\'ll primarily be eating at the FFC (the cafeteria) with meal swipes, and you get a set amount of dining dollars to spend over the semester. Meal plans are unlimited meal swipes and like 180 DDollars, 19 meal swipes a week and around 250 DD or 14 swipes a week with alot more Ddollars. If you\'re living in the AMRs i\'d advise getting a plan with more meal swipes because you\'ll be in the FFC alot, as it\'s right by you. If you\'re going to be in McCoy or Wolman i\'d advise getting the 19 meal swipe one because going to CharMar for food is alot more appealing on a saturday or sunday morning instead of walking all the way to FFC, and you need dining dollars for that. You can change your meal plan after a few weeks so you have some time to test out whatever you choose though. You\'ll inevitably end up going to FFC less as the semester progresses though, so dont overestimate how many meal swipes you need. \n\nAsk me if you have any other questions! I\'m happy to help, as many of the questions I had weren\'t answered that well '",IMPERIALteig,ff4et

One staple of my stay at the Marylander was shower water changing from scolding hot to ice cold. In one particular instance I was making deep passionate love to my then girlfriend. As things progressed I locked eyes with her as I was coming in from behind under the perfect lukewarm water necessary for the ideal shower back door penetration. Suddenly the shower began pouring boiling water onto our exposed bodies. This not only stopped me from putting it in her booty but also led me to suffer second to third degree burns all around my groin and lower stomach. I immediately jumped out of the shower and sprinted to MedStar Memorial Hospital where the doctor wrapped my penis in bandages and told me I couldn't be sexually active for the next six weeks to let my skin grow back. Sexually deprived after three weeks of no boning my girlfriend broke up with me to pursue someone who had a working lower half. Essentially, the Marylander's terrible water piping led my girlfriend of 4 years to break up with me after the fluctuating water burnt my hot dog worse than the FFC burns their burgers.\n\nAnother clear problem with the Marylander is the mold which they attempt to cover up with black paint. All apartments I saw had a layer of black paint where the wall meets the ceiling which upon close inspection proves to be a layer of mold covered in black paint. This is a cheap, low class tactic employed by their management and really reveals the type of people that run the Marylander.\n\nFinally, through the paper thin walls of the Marylander you can hear more disturbing things than in freshmen dorms at Towson. There is constant banging and pounding which either means the Marylander residents are running brothels or they all have basketball courts in their apartments. It would not surprise me if the Marylander mangers themselves were running these brothels, as they seem to have no problem breaking health laws or even any bit of human decency. The brothel would also explain why random men come in and out of the apartment at all hours.\n\nTLDR: Marylander showers caused my dick to burn off and girlfriend of 4 years to break up with me.

Of course there were a lot of courses that were cross-listed as IS and Sociology, but still being able to fit so much in 4 years without the classwork getting overwhelming was nice. \n\nI also really like Baltimore City. If you're from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadephia, etc. it might not be that special, but I came from a pretty boring suburban city nothing like Baltimore. Being able to live in a city was really cool for me, and learning how to navigate through public transportation throughout the city was a valuable skill I have now. Not to mention the city is really cool! Every neighborhood is so distinct, the people in this city are overwhelmingly friendly and the city has a really fascinating history (War of 1812, Civil War, Civil Rights Movement and one of the country's biggest riots, etc.). Living and working in a city like this now with such a history and culture of resilience and pride is really cool.

You don't have to declare a major until the end of your freshman year as an engineer or the end of your sophomore year as an arts and sciences major. Many kids come undecided and it makes no difference to their college experience.\n\n2) Being somewhat conservative is fine. Any school you go to will have people challenging your beliefs but that's what college is about. You won't face any hostility.\n\n3) There is an option to take classes with the Peabody Conservatory of Music. For the most part, though, taking classes at other schools would only happen over the summer. You'll find Hopkins has most if not all of the classes you would want to take.\n\n4) There are distribution requirements for majors but they're not hard to get rid of. Engineers have to take a certain number of math classes, for example. I'm a neuroscience major and I'm required to take physics and chemistry and some math courses, but that's just so I can understand the upper-level material. There is a good amount of freedom in choosing classes. I'm allowed to choose which upper-level neuroscience courses I want to take based off a list of approved classes. My roommate's an economics major and he simply has to take a certain  number of econ courses but most are not required.\n\n5) The JHU community is very friends. It is a top tier college and people work very hard so we don't have the most school spirit but most students find their group(s) of people and are very happy. We have over 300+ clubs/organizations, so there's for sure multiple groups you'd enjoy.\n\n6) Dorms are pretty good. Sophomore housing is great. The food isn't bad. The freshman dining hall is a buffet style and it's pretty good. There are many options everyday.\n\n7) Not at all. Homewood campus is almost exclusively undergrads so you really don't feel any postgrad pressure.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any other questions.""",Toasteroven16,lyuls

Sure it may seem at first that everyone is pre-med destined since elementary for med school, but that doesn\'t mean there aren\'t options to change your mind.  The school has good career counseling services available.  However I will note that JHU is a small school and it seems most degrees are medically focused.  If you don\'t think focusing on human health is your thing, maybe consider elsewhere.\n\n2) You are going to face people challenging your views no matter what campus you go to, and not because your conservative but because college is a time for you to mature in your opinion and discuss them openly.  I have found JHU to be more cordial than my undergrad though.  I\'m more liberal and both the conservatives and liberals here have made well educated discussion here.  No one will be hostile unless you are hostile to them.  Yes we have safe spaces and affirmative action and things are general slanted liberal but its definitely not as extreme as my undergrad where protestors are out across campus and doing sit ins because there is a racial imbalance among the staff.  Here there are lots of open forums and efforts by the staff to have civil discussion.  It\'s nice.  But as always you don\'t have to be involved and most aren\'t.\n\n3) I don\'t know / doesn\'t apply to me\n\n4) I dont know / doesn\'t apply to me\n\n5) I would say JHU personality is ""busy"".  People all work hard and there isn\'t much free time or party life here.  Lots of people locked in study halls all day.  You will make plenty of friends but, again, this isn\'t a large school.\n\n6) the dorms are expensive and the food is awesome but also expensive.\n\n7) There is no emphasis on graduate education but in my experience you will get to have classes and work with grad students who will have a lot to add to your education.

Any advice or comments from past transfers?',518iu2,1473133950,d7alzgs,"b""I was not a transfer-in and dif all four years at JHU. But, I'll try to address some of your points.\n\n1. Greek life is a fairly large part of the party social scene, but there are many many non-Greek clubs and organizations in which you can immerse yourself. But if you enjoying drinking and socializing, you'll need friends who are willing to leave the main Homewood campus area to head to the areas with lots of bars. Otherwise, it's house parties and frat parties. As a transfer in, you probably wouldn't be attending many frat or sorority parties anyway because you wouldn't know any members. But you've said that's something you'd like to get away from, so the bottom line is, if you make other friends, you'll be able to have plenty of fun without JHU Greek life.\n\n2. Living off campus is totally fine, with or without friends. There are lots of decent places to live near the main campus, and you'll make friends who you can go see on campus or off campus.\nOn a side note about living off campus, burglary is a real problem the farther from Homewood you go. It's not like you're  living in a bad neighborhood, but so many students live in the area and so many students have nice computers and TVs, so the area, in spite of proximity to the main campus (and all its attendant security), is a natural target for burglars. \n\n3. The honest answer is that it can be difficult to break into the Hopkins community at any stage. You have to want to make friends and be willing to work to make them because so many students are so driven and frankly less concerned with making friends. Personally, I think it has a lot to do with your major of choice and the kinds of people who choose respective majors as well as the rigor of your major. \n\n4. Only advice would be to really do your research about your major and your interests and see if they are reflected at Hopkins. Are there clubs you can join? Are there organizations and societies that interest you? How passionate are you about your major? Does Hopkins offer your major? If you don't like Greek life, the answers to these questions will lead you away from it and to people who share similar interests (aka friends). But, there's a good chance you'll have friends in Greek life. In my experience, it was more or less unavoidable to have some fun. But if you can tolerate a certain degree of Greek life and are an active outgoing person, you can have a lot of fun at JHU and can get a great (but damn expensive) degree as well.\n\nHope that helps and good luck. Feel free to PM me if you have specific questions in mind.""",Comogia,9bpbp

I think that as a junior, you'll find the social scene is not so Greek-centric as it is for freshmen/sophomores. Also, they have separate orientations for transfer students where they do a lot of things together so from what I've seen, they end up having a pretty tight-knit community. The downside to that is that some of the transfer students who were not as outgoing as others ended up just sticking to other transfers. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can limit your social circle. The Hopkins vibe is definitely very different from USC, so it may fit you better. Good luck!""",seryner,8yyr9

Professors don't hand out grades so you've gotten earn them. \n\nSchool traditions are nonexistent. I've heard other schools encourage more of a familial environment which also doesn't happen here. However, I would say there is a strong bond and camaraderie between the alumni (and some would say arrogance) that I haven't seen from members of other schools. In my conversations between friends and alum, all of us complained about our time, but we wouldn't trade it for the world.

You'll probably hear this a lot, but it is absolutely imperative that you do this. It gives you tons of time to think stuff out if you run into bugs and more time to thoroughly test your code. Most importantly, you'll be able to ask your professors questions early on, and not when they're being bombarded by questions from everyone else like two days before it's due. If needed, you might even have time to completely refactor, which I did a lot in Data Structures. I was one of the very few people who actually started early on things (I am by no means bragging, but really, NO ONE starts early on things and it always kills them lol) and it has really shown in my performance relative to the curve, so to speak. I am definitely not a very smart individual or anything like that, but working consistently over a long period of time as soon as the assignment is given really gives you a leg up because you can code cleanly and carefully with a good understanding of what you're doing.\n\nAnother important thing is to design your code. If you ever take a class with Amir, he will really show you the importance of this. Have a plan for how you want your code to work, and how it will be broken up to accomplish what needs to be accomplished. Code organization is important! Many people will tell you otherwise or blow off design docs, but this is bad in the long run and will make you dig yourself into a lot of holes when things become complex.\n\nKeep your functions concise, as in each function should literally be just that\xe2\x80\x94function to do one thing. In object-oriented languages, do this with your classes as well. Keeping code minimal maximizes code efficiency, since you can reuse a lot of code by calling the small functions you've written. This will come up a lot in Intermediate and Data Structures.\n\nThose are the most important things, I think. Also read Effective Java, this will help you impress people in internships like A LOT. (Source: I wish so badly that I had read it before my internship this summer instead of procrastinating it since 11th grade lol.)\n\nI hope this helps!""",parkourdeer,qo1k5

Both are relatively easy, despite the fact that I didn't have a very good professor for Diff EQ (one could argue for either, actually, since everyone else seemed to dislike my Calc 3 professor).\n\nI personally don't know much about the classes you're taking, but Calc 3 teaches you the general math that you need to know to understand the stuff taught in Diff EQ, though you really only *need* Calc 2 since Diff EQ (at least when I took it) was mostly about memorizing formulas. (Also, I would highly rec taking Linear Algebra before/while taking Diff EQ.) Calc 3 will help you understand those things and I would consider it much more important to any science class or application than Diff EQ just because you'd be able to understand what you're doing better. Also, Diff EQ is slightly easier (although this may be because I took Calc 3 first), so it might be good to take Diff EQ with those courses just so you can learn Calc 3 better. That being said, Diff EQ does help a lot with recognizing different formats of differential equations that you may need to find solutions to in those classes, and might make you faster at identifying and solving the equations that show up in your classes.""",parkourdeer,qo1k5
2shup,b'Calc3 or DiffEQ?',4yqj4a,1471782906,d6q92zn,"b'Ok, so I have a bit of a differing opinion. I took the sequence in the usual order people take it (calc 3 -> linalg -> diffeq) and i\'m not a chembe, but as a bme i have taken other similar engineering classes (systems, models and simulations, etc). From my experience using math in engineering classes, most of what you need from calc 3 (emphasis on in the context of ENGINEERING classes, obviously not pure math and stuff) is how to take partial derivatives, which you can literally learn in two days. The hard, interesting parts of calc 3 (green\'s theorem, stokes\' theorem) which parkourdeer i think is talking about are also less applicable to engineering classes and more of theoretical note. \n\nConversely, even though diffeq may be ""easier"", I literally used differential equations everywhere in my engineering classes, from the first month of material to the last (for example, i\'ve used it on applications ranging from fourier transforms, stability evaluations, models of drug flow, spring/dashpot movements (lol)). In engineering, you\'ll eventually realize that differential equations are merely a (vital!) tool to help you obtain deeper insights, much like i\'m sure derivation felt like a ""tool"" to help you solve more interesting problems in calc BC. You\'ll later see that in your chembe classes, the hard part is getting *to* the differential equation, rather than solving the equation itself.\n\nIn the context of your particular situation, i\'d suggest taking diffeq first, because it\'ll be way more of a struggle to pick up those techniques on the fly than to learn how to do partials which is probably most of the knowledge from calc 3 you\'ll need in the class where calc3 is a prereq.'",multipless,sq9ky
2shup,b'Soph Fall schedule',4yf73d,1471595046,d6ne808,"b""Biochem can be a bit of a pain, just a lot of crap to memorize. When I took it, you're lowest midterm grade was dropped, including the final which was weighted like a midterm. This means if you do well enough during the semester, you don't need to take the final. So potentially not having a final for that class is something too look forward too.\n\nDiff Eq I had a terrible professor for. I also took it in high school and the course was almost exactly like my high school class, so personally I had no trouble in the class. For those reasons, I'm probably not the best judge on the difficulty of this class, but if you're a decent math student, then you'll be fine. My professor also worked 100% off the textbook so the majority of the class didn't even attend lecture. But that'll likely not be the case for you and especially for the first couple weeks I'd suggest attending class no matter what.\n\nPhysics wasn't so bad in my opinion. But it all really depends on how comfortable you are with the stuff. Again, I took it in high school. Physics Lab though is definitely easy to do well in for anyone. Also, there's practically 0 time you need to spend outside the lab doing any work for the class, it's all in-class.\n\nDon't know anything about Spanish, have you taken Spanish in high school? If you already know a bit, I'm sure it'll be easier, no idea on workload or anything like that though.\n\nInto Psych is a traditionally easy course because they used the same exams year after year and everyone had back tests. I heard last year that they actually changed the exams which messed up a lot of people. I would guess that if you can get the back tests from the most recent year you'll be good to go, but even if you properly study for the class, I don't imagine it'll be too terrible. Haven't taken it myself, but even my friends who took it last year after they changed the tests said it wasn't so bad. I think this course may also be offered in the spring, or maybe that's just Intro Soc, I can't remember. If you really need it for the MCAT, then so be it, but it's not a med school req, just recommended at some places and you can always self study it for the exam. That's really up to you though, whatever you're most comfortable with. I would recommend this as the first course to consider dropping if you need to.\n\nIntro AMS I also don't know much about. But if you want to be an AMS major, then this is obviously a required course that you can't put off a year. If it's also offered in the spring, then you'll have to look ahead at when the upper level AMS courses are offered and see if that makes sense to do. Probably best to take it now no matter what.\n\nI think you'll be fine with this workload. Biochem will be a bit of a pain, especially in the days leading up to an exam, but Diff Eq and Physics shouldn't be so bad if you have a solid math background/mindset. Psych a tossup, and I don't know about Spanish or AMS. The good thing about Hopkins is how late the drop date is, so stick with it for a bit and see how it goes.""",DatBlizzard,9ktyk

If you're not, definitely take applied chem so you can get it done in a semester and use the second to take something more interesting (you can basically think of it as chem condensed into a semester).

The trade-off is that you have communal bathrooms, and older dorm, and no suite or amenities that come with that. \n\nWolman is a newer building, and there are some benefits to the suite layout. My friends who lived there said it was also pretty social since people tended to gather in the floor common area, but you have to try a little harder to bring that together.

In my experience this is the most common way to get a house because the market is competitive and usually houses have a lineage through some on campus organization and are passed from member to member.  Usually knowing upperclassmen who are graduating gives you an 'in' and they just tell their landlords that they have new tenants lined up, and there isn't much searching.  Not everyone has this option though, and so here are a couple resources we were looking into before we got our house:\n\n* JHU housing and dinning website had some resources\n* JHU housing and dinning semminar/presentation\n* Searching for management companies in the area (I know American Management is a big one)\n* Zillow might give you some ideas\n* Knocking on doors of houses that you know students live in (even if you don't know the students) and asking if they are moving out and if you and your friends can take over their lease\n\nAll of that is if you are trying to find a house.  If you are trying to rent I recomend contacting the apartment buildings in the area you want to live and asking.  If you think about it you can probably name the buildings, just google the name, find a phone number, and call the management company for information.  Off the top of my head I will list the buildings I remember: \n\n* Cresmont Lofts\n* Village Lofts\n* The Telephone Building\n* Wyman Towers\n* The Blackstone\n* The Charles\n* The Guilford\n* The Varsity\n* Uni One\n* The Marylander\n* Uni West\n* Hop House\n* The Carlton\n\nI hope this information gets you on the right track, I can be more specific if you can give us a little more information:\n\n* House or apartment?\n* How many people do you want to live with?  How many of those do you already know (ie is there a group you want to live with or just you, and if you have 2-3 do you want to be matched with 1-3  more?)\n* Where do you want to live?\n* How much do you want to pay?""",GHOST6,9at64

2shup,"b'Accepted for JHU 2020, any tips?'",3wm1e6,1450047598,cxxi6b0,"b""Don't have a life plan locked in your mind during your freshman year. After my first semester I decided I didn't want to go to medical school anymore. I then spent almost the rest of college planning on getting a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, but just graduated in May without applying to any PhD programs and now I'm planning on getting into medtech design. Plans change, and it's not the end of the world if they do.\n\nAsk upperclassmen in your major for advice to see what mistakes they made that you can avoid.\n\nDon't date in your first semester, maybe even your first year. You will meet a ton of people in that first year.\n\nDon't let your grade define your self-worth. This is very common since a ton of people are trying to maximize their GPAs to get into medical school. I'm not saying don't try your hardest, but don't let it mean so much to you that it starts to affect your mental health and you as a person.\n\nIn a similar vein, don't let school prevent you from making good friends. I'm not sure if covered grades are still a thing, but if they are, use your first semester to get involved in student groups, make lasting friends, and enjoy college life.\n\nHOWEVER, still study your freshman fall! I didn't really study until college, then didn't study fall semester, then got worse grades than I should have in my freshman spring because I didn't learn how to study when I had covered grades. It's a skill that is different from high school that you need to acquire early.\n\nWhen making friends, this is a time to redefine yourself if you want to. Were you really shy in high school, like me? Just realize that everyone here is new and nobody knows you; just talk to people and make friends, they are just as nervous for you. Were you a slacker in high school? Ask people to study with you here, get a group around you that helps you maintain good study habits. Be exactly who you want to be on day one.\n\nSleep.\n\nLastly, if you think of this as the best 4 years of your life, you are just going to be disappointed when you graduate. Sure you can have a heck of a lot of fun and make lasting memories and friends, but think of all the cool shit you'll be able to do after graduation. You'll have money, you can travel, you can try different careers, get married, so much stuff. So enjoy this and make it fun, but don't have the mindset that your level or enjoyment of life is peaking so early.\n\nOK one more thing that I want to reiterate. Don't let grades define you. Don't high mental health disorders, and don't rationalize having them, especially the sort of depression that people can get at Hopkins. If you start to suffer, tell someone.\n""",CrypticParagon,8qq4c

I added CS back in sophomore year. I really like it-- I started taking a few CS classes because I was interested in programming and then decided to go ahead and add the major. \n\nGranted, I really like to program. If you like programming, you'll enjoy at least that aspect of the classes-- with the exception of the theory courses basically every class probably involves programming *somehow*.\n\nI can't speak to internships/research because I do that sort of thing over in physics, or the CIS program, but:\n\nThe core curriculum is very small: there are only like five or six required courses, but you are required to take a *lot* (42 if doing the BS, 36 if doing the BA I think) CS credits to graduate. There are lots of electives, so you can basically take whatever you're interested in. This flexibility is really nice.\n\nAs /u/ModWilliam/ says, the new CS building (Malone Hall) is really nice and brand new. [Enrollment statistics](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/undergraduate-studies/program-tracks/) are here-- the program may be small but it's definitely been getting larger. The CS department recently hired a bunch of new faculty while expanding into their new building too.\n\nThe (first floor) ugrad lab is pretty nice-- I personally *don't* usually work there, unless I'm working with other people in a group or something. There's also the (third floor) ugrad lab, which is generally a lot emptier and maybe a better place to focus on getting work done? \n\nI'd also like to plug the [JHU ACM](https://www.acm.jhu.edu/)-- I'm biased, but despite the status of our website, we're a good resource and we have a largeish office on the ground floor of Malone that's a nice space to work or hang out in addition to the ugrad labs.\n\nHope some of that was useful. :)""",TC01,8vr8k

I suspect that programming-heavy classes are all like this, since programming isn't something you can learn from a lecture - you have to do it in order to learn. That said, having covered grades made it less stressful.\n\nAutomata was a fun class for me. It's really different from what you'd normally expect in CS, since it's a lot of theory and minimal hands-on work. \n\n> Has the curriculum been updated recently?\n\nThe curriculum really depends on the professors, and as far as the intro classes go, the basic ideas don't change much.

Although I realize I'm a STEM guy I think I might be able to give you some interesting perspective.\n\nI really had no idea what I wanted to do when I came to JHU. I started out as an electrical engineer, but I wasn't all that into that. Within my first two weeks I switched to physics (technically you're undecided in freshman fall in the school of arts and sciences). I was amazed at how easy it was to switch majors. All I had to do was get a little form and speak to an adviser in the new department. During my sophomore year I got tired of physics and switched once again to mathematics with a second major in computer science, which was once again a very easy process. I wouldn't worry about being undecided, you can decide here if you want.\n\nI think too often people peg us as a STEM school but I think that this is somewhat uninformed. We actually have the best writing seminars program, as well as the best school of education in the world. I have consistently heard from my friends that our history department is filled with fantastic professors. Personally, I really enjoyed the classes I took in the philosophy department. To top all of that off we have one of the best music conservatories in the world just two stops away on the JHMI (the school's shuttle).\n\nI loved my time in Baltimore at JHU. I would have hated going to a place like Carnegie Mellon where you have to apply to a major and can't really switch later on (at least that was the policy when I was applying). The living's cheap, the character of the city is fantastic; it's a great place to put your foot down. I still have so many friends in the area and visit often.\n\nCheers""",MyTribeCalledQuest,4omi4

2shup,b'[Serious] Baltimore Riot Discussion',345siu,1430264353,cqrizoe,"b'To start off the discussion: Let me just state how I currently see the situation. \n\nWe had several days of peaceful protests for a good cause. It\'s unclear and I think unlikely that those who were violent in the last few days are the same people who were protesting and who care about the cause. \n\nFrom watching local media (mainly WBALTV11) it appears that police have been behaving pretty well and professional and it is sad to see violence destroying this city. I\'m especially convinced that some of these individuals have complete disregard for the original cause with all the assaults on the BCFD trying to put out fires and save lives. ([LINK](https://vine.co/v/eWUr9wQAEMr)) Not to mention the destruction of the new senior center. I have however seen a couple videos of a police officer throwing rocks at protesters ([LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmWuCx_VII), [LINK]()). I\'ve also seen accounts that non-protestors, including white people, at Camden Yards on Saturday were provoking the violence. ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/cW2UMCo.jpg)) I\'ve also seen plenty of videos of protesters, religious groups, and civilians trying to stop the violence and calm the aggressive groups. ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/So98Avy.jpg), [LINK](https://twitter.com/ACFromDaBranch/status/592839101574946817)) The majority of Baltimore is not being aggressive and violent, and most want peace in their own neighborhoods. ([LINK](http://mic.com/articles/116702/10-images-of-the-baltimore-riots-you-won-t-be-seeing-on-tv))\n\nI\'ve also seen quite a few arguments on social media defending the use for violence and destruction. It sounds like the gist is that peaceful protests aren\'t enough, and the only way to get a voice heard is with violent action in a dire situation. I\'m not sure how to feel about this, but I personally still think the destruction of the city buildings, arson, looting, and damaging and destroying civilian and police cars is causing more harm than good. I\'m open for discussion here. \n\nFinally, I\'m curious how the Hopkins ""Bubble"" community feels. Yik Yak obviously has a lot of trolls being racist due to the anonymity, but it\'s possible that some of those are actual opinions of people. And there\'s immature joking about The Wire references. I don\'t condemn racism of course, but how does the JHU community actually feel about this, especially with many being outsiders of Baltimore? One facebook post of note ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/IT48SO2.png)) brings up the argument that JHU affiliates have no right to advocate peace in this situation. I personally can\'t understand this argument, since it seems hypocritical to argue that the violence IS the right thing to do when you\'re in the same situation. I\'m open to counterargument. \n\nI\'m really curious to have a discussion why some believe the violence is justified. Peaceful protests aren\'t easy but they\'ve been very successful and foster much more respect in the past, and that was the original intention of the protesters. '",Sgt_Ice_Bucket,4tg7p

Thoughts?',315qft,1427980620,cpym9z9,"b""Email that Ron Daniels sent out earlier today:\n\nDear Member of the Johns Hopkins Community,\n\nMore than 60 years ago, the U.S. government conducted an unconscionable and unethical experiment in Guatemala, in which U.S. government researchers deliberately infected vulnerable citizens of Guatemala with syphilis and other infectious diseases. We feel profound sympathy for the individuals and families impacted by this deplorable study.\n\nWhen the details of this study came to light, a Presidential Commission determined that the Guatemala Study was funded and conducted by the United States Government. In 2010, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services apologized to all affected. In 2012, a federal district court concluded that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.\n\nToday, attorneys representing Guatemalan plaintiffs announced that they are suing The Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System, alleging that Johns Hopkins was responsible for the study. The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members\xe2\x80\x99 participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself, and therefore that Johns Hopkins should be held liable. \n\nNeither assertion is true.\n\nThis was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. Participation in the review of government research was then and is today separate from being a Johns Hopkins employee, and no nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. Government. \n\nAs a leading global research university, Johns Hopkins values rigorous and open scrutiny of history, even when it is complex and uncomfortable.\n\nWe know that historians have previously linked prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members in various ways to other unethical government research studies in Tuskegee and Terre Haute. Although separate from the Guatemala lawsuit, these studies were all deplorable and all demand reflection upon the broader legacy of unethical research. It is important to confront and learn from the past.  At the same time, we cannot let unfounded allegations go unchallenged. We will defend the institution vigorously in court against legal responsibility for the government\xe2\x80\x99s Guatemala study.\n \nIf you would like more information about the university\xe2\x80\x99s position on the lawsuit, we have released a media statement that you can find [here](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/index.html), along with information about the Presidential Commission on the research in Guatemala and its findings.\n\nSincerely,\nRonald J. Daniels             \nPresident, The Johns Hopkins University                              \n               \nPaul B. Rothman, M.D.\nDean of the Medical Faculty\nCEO, Johns Hopkins Medicine\n \nMichael J. Klag, M.D., M.P.H.\nDean, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n\nSeems like the only connection is some Hopkins faculty members served on the committee that approved funding for this study.

It is weird if you end up never knowing any of the brothers no matter how many times you go, though...\n\nb) Not weird at all, just means you\'ll have to make an extra effort to ""get noticed"" so-to-speak.\n\nc) Yeah most kids will get bids to at least 1 house.\n\nd) I\'d say this depends. If you had your heart set on going to this house and went to all their rush events and they told you they weren\'t going to give you a bid (which happens btw), then that would definitely be weird for both parties going back. Otherwise, it\'s probably chill to stop by for a large gathering like a party. Maybe not the smaller stuff, though.\n\ne) Just get to know the brothers beforehand, if you haven\'t already figured out from first semester what houses suit you then you really need to figure this out during intersession. They all have different personalities and take different kinds of people. Visit a bunch of houses both now and during rush if you need to. Also, if you do rush right, you can think of rushing and pledging each as 4 more credit hours on your schedule.\n\nAll that being said have fun, the rush period is a pretty fun time complete with tons of free stuff and cool events.'",firesIncreaseDPS,7t1cn

It's only weird if someone has told you that you definitively won't be getting a bid, since the entire point of rush is to see what fraternity is a good fit for you. \n\n2) Not at all! That's what rush is for. \n\n3) I don't know the stats, but it largely depends on which house you're looking to join. \n\n4) It definitely depends on the fraternity. Some places will have open parties that literally anyone at Hopkins is invited to, and others won't. This also depends on how you didn't receive a bid: If you were told that you weren't a good fit, then you and the fraternity brothers might feel awkward if you show up. If there are enough people at the house that like you, then you could probably still hang out. \n\n5) Meet everyone possible. Be out going, even if it's a bit uncomfortable, because that's how you'll make connections and have the best shot at joining. The rush commitment isn't that big since there are a few events during the week, but pledging is an enormous time commitment. Most fraternities insist that you prioritize school work and your health before any pledging activity, but I'd say pledging becomes the dominant focus of your life. Which isn't a bad thing: you'll form tight bonds with your pledge class and the older brothers you meet. \n\nSource: recent alum/fraternity brother. Feel free to message me if you have questions.

2shup,b'Just got accepted Early Decision to the JHU Class of 2019!!',2p8lp8,1418575399,cmuezmb,"b""Congrats on the acceptance! I got in a year ago and it seems like yesterday. Enjoy your last semester of high school as much as possible because your grades really don't matter (just don't really fuck up). Since you applied early you probably already like Hopkins, but if you're like I was, there are still a lot of unanswered questions and big question marks about the Hopkins experience.\n\nWhen regular decision stuff comes out you'll start to get access to myJHU, your email, and all the fun forms. You'll get to pick your classes over the summer (at 7am EST or 4 am for West Coasters like me), which is super exciting, but also very stressful because you might not get all the classes you want to take. Finally, you will come to Baltimore a little nervous, but very excited to meet everyone and start school. \n\nOrientation is incredibly fun. The required stuff is meh, but it's basically a week of getting to know awesome people and partying most nights if that's what you're into. Try to meet as many people as possible and get a doorstop so people can stick their heads in and say hi (I live in AMR II and it's awesome). One thing I was worried about was safety in the surrounding neighborhood, but I always feel safe while walking around, even when walking to parties at night. Reply if you want more info on the party scene, but I'm not going to go in depth right now because I don't know if you're interested. \n\nCampus is awesome and there are lot's of great things for you to explore once you get here. It might seem impossible to know where to go, but after a bit of time you will have a general idea of where all the buildings are and what is in them. The best advice I can give you is to find your favorite study space on campus because there are lots of good options. I love the reading room in Brody because it's quiet and awesome, but people like studying in the library or in the rest of Brody. The Gilman reading room is also awesome if you want to get a lot of work done. Your dorm will have places to study too, and your room is always a good option if you can actually get work done. \n\nBaltimore has its ups and downs. I came in with really low expectations so I was really surprised by what Baltimore has to offer. Hampden, the neighborhood to the west of campus, is nice and has good food. It's easy to get around with busses or uber, so going downtown is really fun. You should go to Fells Point with your parents because it is an awesome neighborhood on the water and has lots of good food places. The harbor is nice and has great food, the aquarium, and some places for downtown parties. Orioles games are super fun and pretty cheap. That being said, Baltimore is pretty sketchy and you don't have the freedom to just wander like you can in other places. There are very specific boundaries to where you should go in the area around campus. \n\nI took a really easy schedule for the first semester and loved every second of it. The first semester is a time to make and solidify friendships so it's good to not be super stressed about classes at the same time. You could also take advantage of covered grades and take a hard course load to get stuff out of the way while grades don't matter. I loved all my classes, but definitely check the old course evaluations for reviews of the classes you sign up for (google jhu course evaluations). \n\nCongrats again! You'll be on campus before you know it and I hope you love it as much as I love it. """,hongkongdryclean,54pqo
2shup,b'Just got accepted Early Decision to the JHU Class of 2019!!',2p8lp8,1418647070,cmv8ey9,"b'You\'re getting some great advice in this thread. One thing I would add: Don\'t be afraid of Baltimore.\n\nI\'ll say it again.\n\nDon\'t be afraid of Baltimore. Don\'t be afraid of Baltimore. **Don\'t be afraid of Baltimore.**\n\nUnless Hopkins orientation has changed a lot since I was a freshman, a lot of time will be spent on security walks and seminars that will tell you terrible things about the area. Yes, there is crime here, like in any city, but but there are fantastic people and incredible things to see in places you wouldn\'t otherwise go. People have mentioned Fells Point and Hampden, but I\'d also like to recommend you check out the Mount Vernon area, Canton, and Druid Hill Park.\n\nMount Vernon: Location of Peabody, our sister music conservatory. If you like music at all you can take classes there for (I believe) no extra cost. It\'s also a designated art neighborhood. Hopkins has a pretty crazy independent music/theater/art scene, and a lot of it is centered there. Hotspots:\n\n* [Center Stage](http://www.centerstage.org/)- Largest regional Theater in Baltimore\n* [The Copycat](http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/79#.VI5bCCvF_Xs)- Co-op/commune/venue for performing artists of all kinds. Lots of cool shows/bands happen here. [Schedule & info](https://www.facebook.com/pages/THE-COPYCAT-THEATRE/210387653808)\n* [Fifth Dimension](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-5th-Dimension/353046121374434)- The 5th floor of the H&H building. Mostly awesome weird shit happens here. They tend to throw good holiday parties as well, if you every get tired of the Hopkins party scene.\n\nDruid Hill Park- Just a really nice park.\n\nOther fun stuff-\n\n* [The Baltimore Rock Opera Society](http://baltimorerockopera.org/). Take a cool date here.\n* [ShowSpace](http://showspace.tumblr.com/) List of cool shows and events in Baltimore.\n* [Single Carrot](http://singlecarrot.com/) Other regional theater. Not as weird or ""arty"" as some previous suggestions.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn\'t something you need to think too much about at first. I honestly would recommend spending your first semester checking out all the cool stuff campus/your dorm has to offer and not worrying at all about exploring outside the local neighborhood. But save this post for when you start to get bored of campus. There\'s a Hopkins bubble too many people get trapped in, and you miss out on a lot of opportunities.\n\n----\n\nAlso, good freshman hack. If you meet friends that aren\'t signed up for Uber or Lyft, get them to sign up using your invite code. Every time someone you referred pays for their first ride, you $20 off your next ride. (Essentially a free trip.)\n\nAlso, join /r/Baltimore.'",Yawehg,6nksr

As an economics major I have a lot of freedom to take any class that interests me which is awesome. There aren't any classes that Hopkins makes you take, you just have to end up with a certain amount of humanities, science, engineering, and math classes to graduate. I found this particularly awesome because I hate language and I never have to take language, but it's also great because it gives you the freedom to take whatever you want.\n\nOn the social life side of Hopkins, there are tons of awesome things to do around campus and in Baltimore so I never get bored. There are great clubs to join and I guarantee you will find way too many that sound appealing at the clubs fair. One of my favorite things Hopkins does is bring in awesome speakers in something called the [MSE Symposium](http://web.jhu.edu/msesymposium/about/index.html). If you click there you can see who they've brought in over the years. You can find parties at frats and other houses on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays and these are all pretty fun. Fraternities and sororities have rush in the Spring so you don't have to decide until the second semester. If you get sick of the house party scene you can go downtown to some of the clubs and that's also a good time. I went to an Orioles game and my roommate went to a Ravens game so that's also something fun about Baltimore. The Orioles games are cheap for college students on certain nights, but normal tickets are cheap enough too. The aquarium in Baltimore has discount days to make it cheap and it's worth seeing. The food in Baltimore is amazing and there are some really cool, safe neighborhoods (Fells Point, Inner Harbor, Federal Hill, Mt. Vernon, Hampden). It's pretty easy to get around if you're willing to take busses or spend some money on Uber (it's only around $2-3 to go downtown if you split the fare with your friends). The food at Hopkins is really good (ranked second in the nation), but it's nice to go out with friends to change things up a bit. \n\nOverall, Hopkins is a lot of work, but the friends you will meet and the fun you will have makes it worth it. You wouldn't be able to party like crazy every possible party night like you would be able to at other schools, but you'll have fun as long as you take the time to have fun.

2shup,b'When the Parties Go Dark and the Violence Persists',2lve5f,1415749308,clzfprs,"b""This is terribly argued. Yes, the administration fucked up massively and should be held accountable. At the very least, Dean Boswell should be made to resign. However, it doesn't follow that banning frat parties is a way of dodging that accountability. ~~Every reported sexual assault at Hopkins in the past few years has taken place at frat parties. It isn't as if frats are the only places Hopkins students party. Therefore, one draws the conclusion that there's something particular about frat parties that is conducive to sexual assault, something that seems not to be replicated in other settings.~~ EDIT: I was incorrect about this, see my response to kittycatcate for more info. I believe that most of the rest of my argument stands.\n\nWhile the article isn't exactly clear on what the university *should* do rather than banning frat parties, it seems like there are two solutions. \n\nOne, which I wholeheartedly agree with, is that the university should reform its manner of dealing with victims of sexual assault. The administration's behavior truly has been unacceptable and shameful. \n\nTwo - and here is the real failure of reasoning in the article - is the metaphor of taking the booze away from the alcoholic. It's not frat parties, the author says, but rape culture. Well, okay. There's some truth to that. But as a demand for action by the administration, it's totally incoherent. The implicit demand is that rather than treating the symptom - sexual assault which has been happening ~~exclusively~~ at frat parties - the administration should alter the values and belief systems of all students and non-affiliates involved in sexual violence. First, there's no clear argument put forward as to why they shouldn't treat the symptom *and* attempt to address the root cause. Second, it places an unrealistically large burden on the administration for a problem that demands immediate action. It isn't as if the administration has been capable of eliminating rape culture but is holding off for self-serving reasons.\n\nThis article is self-deluded or dishonest. There may be real arguments to be made for allowing frat parties, but they aren't to be found here. I doubt anyone seriously believes that banning frat parties will solve the problems of sexual violence of Hopkins, but as a triage measure it seems like an appropriate course of action.""",mybaltimoreaccount,7f3xh

Slightly more specifically, ""AI"" as a field isn\'t particularly well-defined anymore.  The huge growth in machine learning has mostly supplanted traditional search-based AI (witness the rise of conferences like ICML and the presence of machine learning at AAAI and IJCAI), although there\'s definitely still interesting work going on in multi-agent systems and other areas that I\'m not super familiar with.  I don\'t know much about ""symbolic systems"",  but there\'s been a bit of a backlash against logic-based mechanisms since the rise of machine learning.  On the other hand, there\'s been somewhat of a surge of interest lately in automated and machine-checkable theorem proving (e.g. the new work on homotopy type theory).  Robotics is kind of its own thing.\n\nAt JHU, if you\'re interested in AI then I\'d recommend talking with some of the machine learning people in the CS department.  Raman Arora is our hardcore machine learning expert, but lots of people do a fair amount of machine learning both for its own sake and for specific applications (e.g. Jason Eisner, Ben van Durme, Ben Langmead, Alexis Battle, and Suchi Saria all come to mind).    \n\nI\'m not sure if anyone is actively working on neural nets, but again that\'s in part because neural nets isn\'t a particularly active field.  There are still some people working on it, but it\'s not what it was.  Take a look at the proceedings of NIPS (http://nips.cc/ ), which is probably the most well-known conference for neural nets.  There are very few actual neural nets papers in there anymore. \n\nBut again, this is all just my opinion -- I\'m no AI expert.  As a theoretician, I\'d say learning more math is never a bad idea.

They will assign you a mentor who will meet with you every so often (maybe once a week or once every other week) and they'll help you improve study habits, help you with classes you struggle with, and just help you get back on track. \n\nYou'll be able to retake the class and it will be replaced on your transcript with an R.

2shup,b'How is Physics and Astronomy at JHU?',22gsob,1396950451,cgmssux,"b'Physics major here. Michael Bloomberg recently gave a butt load of money to the school and a lot of it went into the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy, conveniently located next to the Space Telescope Science Institute. Bloomberg is awesome. All of your physics classes and labs will be in there and the labs, classrooms, and lecture halls are all really nice. There is a physics lab for undergraduates to work together on homework and it is awesome. You will find that in college, doing physics homework independently might not work out so well and working in a group in a room surrounded by whiteboards is very conducive to truly understanding the subject. Every professor at JHU conducts research and a lot of them have multiple teams. There are even more people at STSI who are not professors but professional astronomers. All of these people (there are hundreds) are doing very important things in the world of Physics (Think LHC, nobel laureates, Hubble telescope, etc.). If astro is what you\'re into, this is really a great place to be. I am researching stars, more specifically their distribution in the Milky Way and different methods of calculating their distance. I got this position simply by emailing professors, ""Hey I\'m a physics major, I love your work and would like to be a part of it."" Multiple professors responded and I met with many and even had to turn some down. This is what makes JHU really amazing in my opinion.  JHU spends over 2 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR on research. That number is insane, more than MIT, Stanford, Princeton, or any other school. Not to mention half of that goes to the JHU Applied Physic Lab. Oh and also I\'m a freshman. Yes, I am a freshman doing astrophysical research with an awesome professor at a world-renowned university in something that I am passionate about. The best thing is that I am no exception. 70% of students do research at some point and it is readily available. So research at JHU, A+ all the way. Its a very important part of JHU\'s philosophy and an important part of getting everything you can out of the university. Whatever you\'re into I promise you that you will find a professor who is interested in the same thing and there is nothing stopping you from dropping by their office or sending an email inquiring about joining in their study. I urge you to check out the physics and astronomy website and see for yourself. Also check out the movie Particle Fever. I actually ran into Dr. Kaplan (the guy with the ponytail if you watch the trailer or the movie) today on my way to class. But research obviously isn\'t all there is to your education here. Like many top schools, you will find that some professors who are brilliant physicists are absolute shit at teaching physics. If you are a physics major, you will never take a physics class that has more than ~40 people in it. I promise. This means that you can have a lot of individualized attention and the grad students (there are many) can be very helpful. On the other hand a lot of them and the professors as well are just oblivious and only care about their research. Some can\'t even speak english. So some professors suck and others you will love. I\'d give the instruction here a B. Not bad, but certainly could be better. If you have other questions concerning the school (atmosphere, social life, etc.) or anything else about Physics just message me. I know this is long but as a physics student here I feel obligated to tell you everything about it and a lot I have left out. To answer your specific questions. As a freshman, I can\'t really answer physics advising as I don\'t yet have an advisor (you get one at the end of freshman year). All internships take place during the summer so no need to worry about commuting. That question is kind of irrelevant to JHU though. I know nothing about the Carnegie Institution nor other internships in DC. It\'s not like JHU will just give you an internship. You have to apply and enhance your resume and interview and get recommendations (all of which you can do here obviously). So seriously message me if you want to ask more questions because as a freshman physics major I am literally exactly where you could be in a year. '",rip_the_fabric,fxi42
2shup,b'How is Physics and Astronomy at JHU?',22gsob,1396958986,cgmwst9,"b""Just graduated from the department last year.  The department has a lot of great professors, and also the Space Telescope Science Institute across the street, giving you access to a lot of people you can do research with if you're interested in their work.  I knew people who did research with Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in 2011, doing astronomy work, people who did particle research with the data from the LHC, people who had interesting condensed matter labs, and people who dealt with instrumentation and building satellite components.  The research opportunities you want are there.  \n\nAs far as quality of professors and classes goes, I think the department is pretty strong.  Physics majors take their own version of Physics 1 and 2 separate from the rest of the university, which I think is pretty great.  You get a smaller class with more personal attention, and you typically get some great professors teaching.  Also it gives you a great chance to meet most of the people also doing Physics in your year.  Not every professor is amazing, but I doubt that's the case anywhere.  For almost all of my courses, though, I got the feeling that the professor was interested in teaching the material and working with the class, and many were incredibly accessible for office hours.  \n\nSPS, the society of physics students, is constantly putting out bulletins for internship and research opportunities, both near and far.  I don't think I knew anyone who commuted to internships during the year, though.  I saw it mostly over the summer.  That said, that could also just be because of the time consuming nature of commuting if you were to head into the DC area.  I got a research fellowship one summer that wasn't local, so I don't know much about summer internships in the area, but I know a few people who were at APL for the summer.  I believe they got housing closer to DC for the summer, rather than commute, though.  \n\nOne other thing that you didn't ask about, but I think is worth mentioning, is that all of my friends and I that finished with a degree in Physics are either employed or in grad school, or are about to start after purposely taking some time off.  Among the people I know, not one of them had trouble finding placement after finishing their degree.  Pretty happy to see things work out like that.  """,Jernon,48r1w

If the honors class still uses Carothers, that's a really good book.  Lots of good details and very thorough.  McTague sat in on some of the grad courses I took last year.  He seems like an okay guy, and english is his first language.  There are way worse options in terms of professors, so I'd say go for it.  \n\nI think in terms of all math classes workload is highly dependent on the professor.  In terms of difficulty, I think everyone has different feels for analysis v. algebra.  Usually you are more capable at one versus the other, but unfortunately you have to take both.  If this is your first 400 level, you'll probably have to get used to writing proofs.  That is a fun transition.\n\nEdit: P.S. I took the non-honors analysis at the undergrad level.  That was a huge waste of time.  Don't bother.  Ended up taking the grad version to make up for all the stuff I didn't learn.  Grad version is also infinitely more difficult.""",kittycatcate,4z9ql

This school will grind you. It will take whatever naive belief you have in your superiority and crush it. It will take your perceptions about the glory of academic research and replace it with the realities of science funding and lab grunt work in modern academia. It will go to great lengths to ensure that you realize that it is virtually impossible to do anything meaningful on your own and that you will need to ask for help to achieve things. \n\nThere's a very real difference between arrogance and self-confidence. The first I think is where you feel like you should know everything. In this case when you realize you don't it's almost paralyzing. The second is where you know exactly where your limits lie and that it's perfectly fine to reach out to others when you encounter something you can't fully comprehend. \n\nWe have our own share of arrogant people, because some individuals will always be that way. But I think Hopkins is among a increasingly smaller number of schools where the environment is engineered to change arrogant people into self-confident ones. It's really hard to think you're the best ever when you're only an average student at Hopkins and getting B-'s in your core classes. \n\nIn the short term, this is somewhat problematic. There will be long bouts of unhappiness and self doubt and a sense of imposter's syndrome. In terms of what is probably better for you in the long haul, it's easy for me to say that what Hopkins puts you through is worth it. \n\nIf this hasn't convinced you and you want actually want an easy go around in college, then I suggest making the opposite choice that I did and take advantage of [the alarming grade inflation at one of our peer institutions.](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/3/grade-inflation-mode-a/) """,jhu,57uyu

Imo, the tenured ones didn't put as much effort into their class instruction because they knew their position would not be jeopardized. Two of the newer history professors coming in were non-tenure and visiting were by far the BEST academic scholars and mentors I've had. They took time to actually help me with my research projects, met with me one on one throughout the week, and taught wonderful classes. This can hardly be said for the one other tenured prof who didn't give a shit about his class and was so lazy, the lecture slides didn't even have words on them half the time. I don't think decreasing tenure would be a bad thing, it'd make professors actually do what they are supposed to do instead of goofing around.

I also worked for the student PR team for admissions for awhile, and I approached that question completely differently.  Especially in one-on-one admissions interviews, I was blatantly honest.  It\'s tough.  It\'s not a walk in the park on a sunny day.  You\'re not going to be perfect all the time.  You are probably going to end up with test scores or a grade or two (or many) that you wish didn\'t happen.  \n\nThe most important thing is to grow and learn you have to understand and accept what you don\'t understand.  Without a struggle, the long run just isn\'t worth it.  I once had a math TA at Hopkins that told me to study for an exam I should do every single problem in the book until I get one wrong.  Once you get something wrong you\'ve identified the limits in your knowledge.  College is not about boosting your ego, or hanging your grades on your parents\' fridge, or making Dean\'s List every semester.  It\'s about gaining valuable and essential knowledge in your field so that you can solve real world problems after college, and to do that you need to identify and push those limits.  I\'m probably where I am today because during my college experience I had some test scores that yelled, ""Hey, you don\'t know as much as you thought, eh?"" That pushed me to work harder and push myself to TRULY understand the field I was studying.  I am thankful that Hopkins drove me into the ground more than a few times because that\'s all I needed to push myself to do the best I possibly could.  \n\nIf you want a relaxing and carefree college experience, that\'s not Hopkins.  If you want to work hard, and reap those benefits in the future then it\'s a good choice.

2shup,b'Any Econ/Math majors?',1op7ep,1382134857,ccubl5x,"b""Economics / Applied Math major here. The two disciplines are in different schools (Applied Math is in Engineering and Economics is in A&S) so there's not much overlap between the majors. I'll cover both separately. \n\nThe Economics department here is quite good in a lot of ways, and I have enjoyed my time here. You will begin your first year taking either Elements of Micro with Professor Hamilton or both Elements of Macro and Elements of Micro if you did not take AP Macro (I am not sure who teaches the Elements of Macro course as it changes yearly, Maccini taught the course for many years but he recently stepped down from teaching). Professor Hamilton's course is fairly notorious for being difficult, but I found it a good intro to the economics department and economics in general. It should be a course that helps to gauge whether you want to continue with Economics. Additionally, you can also take Intermediate Macro alongside Elements of Micro if you feel you are sufficiently prepared (so you can jump ahead a semester- Elements of Macro is offered in the fall and Elements of Micro is offered in the spring, but Intermediate Micro is in the fall and Intermediate Macro is in the spring). \n\nAfter the elements course you will have your two intermediate courses and will also be able to take about half of the elective courses in the department (you really can't do much until you get Elements of Micro / Macro done except possibly some 200 level courses). The intermediate courses include calculus based problems and are more rigorous classes for Sophomores / Juniors. I would say most economics majors complete both the classes Sophomore year (fall and spring). \n\nOnce the elements and intermediate sequences are done you have Econometrics and about five elective courses left (these elective courses can be taken alongside the core courses so you can be pretty much done with all the elective requirements by junior year if you want to be). Econometrics is basically applying statistical analysis to economics and is important for research and the like. If you squeeze your schedule it's relatively easy to complete all the undergraduate economics requirements by first semester of Junior year. This leaves a lot of time left, and it really depends on what your goals are for what you do after.\n\nA lot of the students in economics are interested in banking / finance / business. JHU (like many other top 20 schools) doesn't have an undergraduate business program and so a lot of students use economics as a sort of surrogate business major. If your goal is specifically finance / banking / something not super quant heavy then I would suggest pairing economics with another social science major like international studies. Economics / international studies is generally easier for students than economics and math or applied math would be (and your cumulative GPA is a fairly important factor in getting jobs, less so for graduate school as performance in specific courses matters), but do what you enjoy.\n\nIf you want to do go further in economics (research or graduate studies for example, as it sounds like you do) then you can also do that. You can begin taking graduate classes as early as you are ready. The earliest you would probably do this is second semester of Junior year, but most probably senior year. All graduate courses are open to undergraduates who are sufficiently prepared, so you can continue on with economics as far as you would like. Taking upper levels undergraduate / graduate courses may be important for graduate school admissions if that is your thing. \n \nAs for research, there's unfortunately not a whole lot you can do your early years. Economics is not like hard sciences where you can work in a lab and easily help out. Most research opportunities are for students who have at least completed econometrics (so at least junior year) and who have some additional math / economics background and know the professor. I wouldn't count on being able to do much research (especially early on) but graduate schools know this and take it into account. You will most likely be doing data collection or something similar for a professor if they needed any help. However, the department is hiring quite a few young professors so this may change a bit as it expands. Additionally, there is the option of doing a senior thesis which will allow you to get some research under your belt before you graduate. There are quite a few outside research options during the summer / breaks also. \n\nAs for the fields you mentioned, you really won't be able to specialize early on as that happens mostly in graduate work. There are elective courses in the department on game theory, and microeconomic theory is covered in elements / intermediate / graduate courses. Really the important thing in economics is taking as many classes as you can (and doing well in them), getting to know the professors, and being on the look out for research opportunities when they present themselves. \n\nAs for Applied Math, I am a lot less active in the department as I enjoy economics more, but doing Math is pretty much necessary for graduate school. (I would personally do Applied Math over pure Math if you had no prior preferences and graduate school was your only goal.) You will be taking all the usual required classes such as Calculus 1,2, and 3, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Probability, Statistics, Optimization, etc. The optimization course in the department is pretty popular (as you mentioned you are interested in that). Also, there are some computational economics / finance classes that can be interesting and helpful. I know the Applied Math department also has opportunities for undergraduate research but again I'm not too involved there. \n\nIn sum, Economics / Math is fairly straightforward, especially if you want to do graduate studies. Both departments are strong and have plenty of opportunities to go as far as you need or desire to. PM me if you have any questions (I also know of a few economics research programs outside of JHU if you are interested in those). \n\nBest of luck!""",gogogadgt,dk5tr

Officers, detectives, jail cells, guns, etc. \n\nIt baffles me that JHU doesn\'t do the same. Baltimore city police are underfunded and have much better things to do than be a JHU police presence. How often in those security bulletins does it say ""Baltimore police arrived and search the scene with negative results""---how much crime might be deterred if there was a full time police presence just for JHU, and then how much quicker could they respond to events if they were stationed locally and only dealt with the JHU areas.

They were pretty easy to do and they weren't graded that hard. Bottom line? Do the reading and make sure you study and you'll do fine. However, regardless of the work, Dr. Feigenson is a phenomenal lecturer. Hands down one of the best that I had in my time at school.

Microsoft came this year, there were probably others but there weren\'t a ton.\n\nOne thing we do get that I think is somewhat unique to the CS department: a LOT of emails about startups looking for CS people. Sometimes some former JHU students started a company, sometimes it\'s a company in the Baltimore area. If it isn\'t a startup it\'s usually a temporary position, like ""we need someone to help build our Android app or upgrade our database this summer"" or something like that.

Pretty much, we didn't want specific members to be excluded from being able to use the pool for personal modesty reasons, so the only way to equal it out was to make it the way it now is. Now, I don't know if this is extending into the school year, and if so, to what extent, but for now they made it this way.

2shup,b'Student interested in transferring to Hopkins...',1dt427,1368038596,c9upxns,"b'Transfer student here.\n\nThe transition for me has been interesting. I transferred from a small liberal arts college very far from JHU in the middle of nowhere. The atmosphere at my old college was completely different. There was a very tight student body, the professors were 100% focused on undergrads and not research, and the administration was very laid back, responsive, and friendly. So, take all this into account when reading my comment. I have also visited nearly every single top tier school in the US and I think I have a pretty good sense of the pros and cons of most major universities in this country. Anyways, coming to Baltimore was quite a transition for me. After experiencing JHU, here\'s what I\'d have to say:\n\nThe Cons:\n\n1. I don\'t think there is much of a student community here or a lot of expressed school pride. Most people seem content in their own worlds, doing their own things with their group of friends, and pursuing their own goals.\n\n2. The surrounding area isn\'t great (and sometimes kind of unsafe) but it is getting better. Plus, I think JHU has a pretty good security force. In terms of things to do, there isn\'t a whole lot outside of a few bars. But, the harbor is relatively nearby and Towson/Loyola are just up the road. \n\n3. The administration and the professors can be somewhat distant. There is more of a focus on research over undergrads. There are always exceptions to this, but in my view there is a huge emphasis on personal responsibility. YOU have to go out and seek opportunities and meet people and make sure you get good grades. No one is going to look after your shoulder or hand you things. Sometimes you might have to be a bit pushy yourself.\n\nThe Pros\n\n1. The students and professors here are all very smart people. I have met some of the smartest people I\'ve ever known in my life. Of course there are slackers and ""how-did-they-even-get-into-this-college"" types of people at every school. But in general, I can be confident that whoever I\'m talking to is a smart person with interesting ideas. The professors are also often world-class and have a wealth of knowledge (although some of them can be kind of socially awkward and/or boring)\n\n2. JHU is very diverse. My old college was extremely homogenous (maybe even a bit prejudiced). Here, I\'ve met students from all over the world with so many different backgrounds. There\'s a good amount of racial integration in social groups as well. Plus, contrary to what people may say, I think people here are pretty friendly and not too cutthroat.\n\n3. JHU has so many opportunities and resources. It\'s location isn\'t bad (it\'s THE university in Baltimore with schools all over the city). It\'s a quick train ride from DC (where there are even more schools). And it provides so many academic programs, research opportunities, networking opportunities, etc etc. \n\nWhen I got accepted into JHU, I was beyond elated. Yes, coming here was a huge transition and there was a tradeoff of pros and cons. But, I don\'t regret my decision. You currently attend a large state college and so you might actually find JHU to be a warm and tight-knit environment - who knows. I was also attracted to JHU for its academics, and I have not been disappointed. \n\nAs for application advice, I\'m not really sure. I was a good student but I wasn\'t anything spectacular (I definitely did not have a 3.9, although I did make Dean\'s List every semester). I was active in a small handful of ECs, but I didn\'t have any leadership positions. I think what really helped were 1. my grades, 2. my essays, and 3. my professors\' recommendations. My transcript showed an upward trend in grades and difficulty in classes, and I got to know my professors very well and they felt comfortable in writing me solid recommendations. The important thing for the essay is to never outright bash your old college. Always focus on the positives and the potential improvements. For example, instead of saying ""X University has had poor academic opportunities"", say ""X University has provided many academic opportunities for me. However I believe that JHU will better provide me with the resources that I need."" Bad writing but you get my point. Don\'t sound like you\'re bitter or that you dislike your college. State that you\'ve appreciated and learned from the experience you had, but you\'re seeking something more. Also, add specifics. Show that you know about the college and what you want to gain from going there. Don\'t make your essay sound generic. A good test is if you take out the word JHU in your essay, can you still tell that it\'s about JHU and not just about any other college? Writing a transfer essay can be 10x harder than writing just a normal application essay in high school. It\'s especially hard since there aren\'t any real guides for transfer apps. You\'re kinda on your own if you want to transfer.\n\nHistorically, the transfer rate to JHU has been atrociously low (less than 5%) and because of that, JHU isn\'t the most transfer friendly school. But, you seem to be in better shape than I was when I applied. Maintaining a good college record is difficult and will put you leagues ahead of the crowd when applying. Sorry for the long post, but I hope it helped. I hope to see you on campus soon!'",townhouse45,blomc

Since the program is designed to be a four year program, it is extremely competitive to transfer directly into the BME program at Hopkins. In the last few years no transfer applicants have been offered admission into the BME major and that trend is expected to continue in the future.""  \n\n>""If space ever opens up in the BME program (and that is an extremely rare occurrence that hasn\'t happened in the past three years) those spots would be filled by currently enrolled freshmen engineering students, not transfer students. Simply put, transfer students applying to Hopkins should not consider BME as an option. ""\n\nThat being said, research labs tend to not really care what major you are, as you generally won\'t know much about their research going into it so they teach you what you need to know over time (for example, I work in a lab that\'s VERY multidisciplinary, and has MechE\'s and BME\'s and CompSci majors). So maybe look for research that interests you, see what department it is in, and if it happens to not be in BME, you\'re in luck!  \n\nAnd just in general, I\'d really recommend you try looking into alternative paths to BME, but if you are DIE-HARD, VERY SET ON IT, then it is somewhat sometimes feasible to hop into BME your sophomore year. It\'s very difficult though. One kid I know who did so is an absolutely exemplary student, and was enrolled in an equally as difficult program prior to switching to BME. He actually wasn\'t allowed to switch, but he just started taking all of the BME-required classes and sort of brute forcing his way into the program, and by junior year when he demonstrated to the department head that not only was he on track for BME requirements, but was also doing very well academically, they finally gave him the go-ahead to officially switch into the department.

Not only did it achieve nothing, it made the smokers more agitated with walking out some distance into the heat to smoke, and there was a literal white and orange line from discarded cigarette butts that divided the part of campus where I was living and off-campus property.  Granted, that's not indicative that things will be that bad here, but I thought it was a pretty good illustration of how abysmally an idea like this could fail.  """,Jernon,48r1w

Seems a bit of a stretch doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\n\nAccording to another article on VFL, their leader says that:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of Voice for Life\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the practice of sidewalk counseling, our members frequently stand on the public sidewalk outside the abortion clinic on N. Calvert Street, and speak to women in a **peaceful, non-aggressive manner**, hand out literature, provide information about life issues and the abortion clinic itself \xe2\x80\x94 in an effort to persuade the individual (it may be the parent, boyfriend or the woman herself) not to have an abortion, and to choose life for the child in the womb.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem it is their intention to be in people\xe2\x80\x99s faces or wanting to confront people directly.\n\nPerhaps we are on a case of confirmation bias.

Linking this group to a white supremacist group is distasteful...especially coming from the student government. Then again, I have no opinion on this issue...seems a bit overblown. \n\nHowever, I will say this. Someone on the SGA was on the JHMI today and decided to declare things very loudly while being on their phone with their mother. Apparently, VFL is suing the school and a Congressmen from Virginia has already written a letter to the school along with three other lawyers. Hopkins wants to avoid the fiasco, and the SGA president has asked the committee to approve of the group. However, the committee threatened to resign because they thought it would make their own jobs meaningless. The leaked emails meant that VFL has physical proof of bias against their group and in all likelihood, will win in a court of law. Hopkins is just trying to keep things hush so it doesn't get any bad reputation. On the other hand, the area VFL demonstrates in already has a bad view of Hopkins and if they do anything wrong, it would make the situation between the community and Hopkins even worse.

I started at Hopkins in December. I quickly noticed that we were good at sharing all the good, serious news about Hopkins on Facebook/Twitter, etc., but we could also do a better job of listening, engaging and having even a little fun. The vast majority of our social communications are indeed ""professional"" -- we share a lot of news from The Hub (hub.jhu.edu). But sometimes, too much ""professional"" crosses over into boring. \n\nWe hate boring. We do not attract the best and the brightest with boring, overly-scripted messages and public relations. We want to be authentic -- and we have a ways to go. We do exciting things at this university. You all are terribly bright. We have a chance to show the world how awesome this place is through social media. We should think big.\n\nOn Facebook alone, we\'ve tripled our engagement year-over-year -- people really do engage with those so-called unprofessional posts. We want Facebook to be a space for two-way conversation. Casual conversation is fine with us.\n\nDo you know what the Hopkins community has rallied around? Simple, community-based messages. The community (you all!) loved that the Ravens won the Super Bowl, and you were in Baltimore to celebrate. You loved that our school was involved in finding a potential cure for HIV. You loved celebrating our 137 years of existence earlier this year.\n\nSo, in short, we want to make Hopkins a smaller place through our social media efforts.\n\nI\'d really like your help in helping make the JHU community the best laboratory and playground for social media that we can make it.

2shup,b'Class of 2017! Tips?',14vhee,1355566747,c7gt4wu,"b""First off, congratulations! Second half of senior year is so great after knowing you're set after graduation! :] \n\nHere are a number of suggestions just off the top of my head. I might edit this post so that there's more later. I hope they serve you well:\n\n* The library gets crowded quickly and often, so make sure you take advantage of [room reservations](http://rooms.library.jhu.edu/) ahead of time... Like exactly 24 hours ahead of time. You'd be astounded by how competitive it has become to get rooms in BLC.\n* You can get to BWI by taking the JHMI to Penn Station and then the Light Rail southbound. It requires a transfer: you just get off where the train from Penn ends, and get on the one toward BWI and take that to the end. The Light Rail only costs students $1.10, whereas taxis can be $30+. Some say it's dangerous or sketchy, but I've never had a problem riding it.\n* Chinese food is better at the med campus than around Homewood. Hot Mustard and Taste of China are nice places. Don't bother with Orient Express among other poor quality places. For delivery, I'd recommend Paul Chen, and Zhongshan.\n* Chinese food aside, Baltimore has lots of great restaurants. Take advantage of [Restaurant Week](http://www.baltimorerestaurantweek.com/) to try out some great places! Alchemy, Kali's Court, Prime Rib, there are too many to name. You'll have to get off of Charles Village for the really good stuff though.\n* And even on normal weeks, don't just stay on campus. Use the [Collegetown Shuttle](http://www.baltimorecollegetown.org/shuttle/), [JHMI Shuttle](http://www.parking.jhu.edu/shuttles_jhmi_homewood.html), [Charm City Circulator](http://www.charmcitycirculator.com/), and MTA buses (just Google Map transit directions to where you want to be) to get to Towson, and other more adventurous parts of Baltimore. Additionally Hampden is also a nice walk away.\n* Enjoy Greek life as a freshman. It's a great way to meet new friends (while drunk) so you'll have lots of faces around campus you'll recognize (while drunk). You'd be surprised by how many really intelligent people happen to be the really heavy drinkers. Plus this counts as networking, right?\n* There's a food court in Levering basement. Just saying, because apparently some friends of mine didn't know this until their third year.\n* The Digital Media Center has some really fancy electronic equipment you can rent out. Go through their training process and be able to take out cameras, recording devices, etc. on a whim.\n\nMore generic advice that's not JHU-specific:\n\n* Don't buy textbooks until after you start going to class. You'll find that often you won't need them, or you might want to switch out. Actually, don't buy at all when you can borrow from a friend or the library.\n* Declare additional majors and minors early on. You'll get emails from the department regarding events, free food, and internship opportunities.\n* Make friends with people in your major and get a decent study group going. I owe a lot of my grade to being able to work with my team on homeworks and projects.\n* Make friends with some upperclassmen. Previous year's exams and materials are very helpful for studying and doing well on exams.\n* Stay organized, and make to-do lists. It really makes everything less stressful when you break it into more manageable pieces.\n* Keep an eye on what you want to do with your future. While it won't matter too much the first few years, it won't hurt to have that on your mind so that if a great opportunity comes, you'll be ready.\n* Don't rush into too many extracurricular activities or commitments though. Try a lot, but don't commit to too many just so you'll have your options open. And unlike high school, having a bunch of extra clubs may not be as constructive or beneficial so make sure you choose to do only what you truly enjoy doing.\n* Try new things! Be it research, part-time work, volunteering, etc. Keep an open mind and you'll be able to make your time a great experience!\n\nBest of luck!\n\nP.S. /r/jhu is also a great resource, but you already know that so you'll be good. :]""",Dreamamine,70wnr

If you get problems with your roomates, you don't have to worry about other ppl damaging your lease. \n\nIf you decide to do cresmont.

I feel like this treatment only breeds resentment, not unity as most proponents would argue.\n\nI'm all for an initiation type thing, where the freshmen for one night have to run around and do all sorts of silly stuff. But it must be stressed that they are not being forced to do anything they are not comfortable with, biggest thing being drinking. If they choose not to drink, that should be respected.\n\nI suppose it's just a mindset toward freshmen that is the biggest indicator. If you think freshmen should be treated like dirt, I'm definitely not going to agree with a lot of hazing/initiation ideas you're gonna have. If you think we need to see if freshmen can take a joke at the expense of a bit of their dignity (e.g. walking through the quad singing Disney songs at the top of their lungs), I'm all for it.\n\nIt's definitely a blurry area and this debate won't go away for a long time.

2shup,b'Loving hopkins so far. Have a few questions',zcejo,1346827909,c63i0tk,"b""Spring fraternity rush for freshmen is very laid back and much more casual than sorority rush. Most fraternities will post their own calendars of events for the two weeks of rush. Don't try to rush too many fraternities, because you won't make enough of an impression on the guys of any one group. Focus on rushing two or three places. Don't rush a fraternity if you don't enjoy hanging out with the people in it. Fraternities will give you a bid, but you make the final choice on which fraternity to join or to go Greek at all.\n\nHere's a basic rundown of the fraternities\n\n1) Wawa (Alpha Delta Phi) - Currently the football frat, but they're trying to change it up a bit\n\n2) AEPi (Alpha Epsilon Pi) - Jewish fraternity and lacrosse hecklers\n\n3) Beta (Beta Theta Pi) - Nice guys in general, but there's a preppy dress code\n\n4) Lambda (Lambda Phi Epsilon) - Asian fraternity with a surprisingly low GPA\n\n5) PhiDelt (Phi Delta Theta) - Newest fraternity. Basically Beta without the dress code\n\n6) FIJI (Phi Gamma Delta) - Keep to themselves, don't do much on campus besides PhiPsi 500\n\n7) PhiPsi (Phi Kappa Psi) - Water polo and rugby. Not allowed to affiliate with Bloomberg anymore\n\n8) PIKE (Pi Kappa Alpha) - If you can stand PIKE parties for four years, then join\n\n9) SAE (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) - Solid group of guys, with a lot of wrestlers\n\n10) SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon) - Former high school athletes that like to watch sports together\n\n11) SigChi (Sigma Chi) - Individually, brothers are nice. As a group, pretty creepy.""",robotnik92,71q0q
2shup,b'Loving hopkins so far. Have a few questions',zcejo,1346841447,c63lfnp,"b'I think getting rid of JHU Confessions was the best thing to happen to Greek Life here. We seem to get along better now that that cesspool of a web site is gone. Fraternities all come with their own reputations, some of them totally unwarranted, some of them probably pretty true. The most important thing is you *must* decide for yourself. Don\'t get pressured into joining a frat that only parties all the time if you\'re not comfortable doing that. Likewise, don\'t get pressured into joining a ""nerdy"" frat if you plan on partying all the time. You don\'t want to be stuck in a situation you don\'t love for the next four years and beyond. Fraternity is an eternal brotherhood that lasts long after you graduate. Make sure you put 100% into your decision.\n\nI\'m in a fraternity and I have friends in pretty much every fraternity on campus. I have nothing against other frats here. Every place is different. You have got to talk to brothers, go to different parties, attend rush events, do your research, etc. If you decide solely based on reputation, whether they happen to be accurate or not, you\'re probably going to regret your decision.\n\nIn general, Pike, SAE, Sig Ep, and Phi Delt throw the most parties, probably in that order. Wawa has stuff ocasionally, they\'re located right next to Pike on North Charles. Sig Ep is way back behind the Baltimore Museum of Art, but they have a cool house. SAE, Phi Delt, and Sig Chi are all around 29th-30th street on St. Paul. Phi Psi doesn\'t throw parties too often, but when they do they\'re a good time. The Lingerave needs to be experienced at least once. FIJI has the ""Islander"" day party during Homecoming every year and that\'s awesome. AEPi frequently throws jams in the Northway apartments where a bunch of brothers live. Beta has a newish house right behind Subway but I think they\'ve been doing more invite-only stuff as of late. Every frat has its pros. I know I\'ve said this like a million times, but you need to decide for yourself. Everything I\'ve said is just *my opinion*. It isn\'t gospel. You have no reason to trust me, I\'m just an anonymous dude on the internet. I am however trying to be unbiased and helpful. So...hope this helps a bit. '",TPaine16,4iugk

This isn\'t summer camp.  \n* Glass pavilion = ""glass pav"", Milton S. Eisenhower Library = ""MSE"", Brody Learning Commons = ""BLC"", University Market = ""UniMini"", Fresh Food Cafe = ""FFC"", Charles Street Market = ""CharMar"".  Never use the long forms.\n* All of the freshman dorms have study rooms - during finals time, when MSE (and now BLC) will probably be full, people often forget about these.\n* Do intersession.  There\'s no reason not to, your meal plan applies during that time, and it\'s literally just three weeks of getting to hang out with friends on campus.\n* Get the unlimited meal plan freshman year.  Especially if you live in AMR I or II or Building A or B.  The extra dining dollars are not worth it.  Unlimited trips to FFC are.\n* Conversely, your sophomore year, get the plan with the smallest amount of dining dollars.  You\'ll probably still have too many left at the end of the year.\n* There\'s a guy who hangs out on St. Paul street named Crazy Mike.  Don\'t give him money, he usually just spends it on cigarettes.  Mostly just don\'t interact with him and you\'ll be fine.\n* Don\'t walk east of North Calvert street alone.  Don\'t walk south of 29th street alone.  There\'s not much reason to walk past there anyway.\n* If you don\'t drink and/or smoke, be aware that a significant portion of your classmates will.  If you\'re going to judge people for it, prepare to find yourself isolated from a large number of your classmates (not saying you have to do it, but judging people for it won\'t make you any friends).\n* If you\'re going to drink but have never drank before, don\'t think you\'ll suddenly become pro at taking shots and chugging.  Even if you have drank before, don\'t think you\'re some kind of alcohol expert.\n* Your RA is not your friend.  They are there to help you, but they are paid to do so.  Some of them are still pretty cool people, but don\'t tell them about how much you drank last night or how much weed you\'re planning on smoking.  If you see them at a party, you don\'t have to hide from them, but don\'t go up and talk to them.  Also, don\'t flirt with them, and definitely don\'t sleep with them.\n* People here will have sex.  Deal with it.  As long as they\'re not disrupting others, it\'s their business.  Girls who have sex with lots of guys aren\'t ""sluts.""  Guys who have sex with lots of girls aren\'t ""players"" or ""man whores"".  They\'re just people who have lots of sex.\n* Getting caught with alcohol by an RA is not the end of the world.  They\'ll take the alcohol from you, write a situation report, and give it to their superior.  At worse you might have to write an essay or do a video series on the dangers of alcohol.  Sometimes, nothing even happens.  Getting caught with weed by an RA is much worse - if they actually see weed, they are required to involve Baltimore PD.\n* This school does not want to see you arrested.  HopCops are not Baltimore PD and are not there to arrest you.  The ""shush lady"" is not there to get you in trouble.  She is there to stop people from getting in situations where BPD would get involved.  You can walk by a HopCop clearly drunk and it won\'t matter as long as you\'re functioning and behaving yourself.  If a HopCop or the shush lady tells you to go home, listen to them.  They are looking out for you.\n* MOST IMPORTANTLY: You\'re probably going from being a big fish in a little pond to being a little fish in a big pond.  Deal with it.  Don\'t act like you\'re still the shit.  No one cares about your SAT scores or your high school GPA.  Everyone here is just as smart as you - most people don\'t get into Hopkins unless they\'re smart (those guys here for lacrosse are still trying to get a good education too).  Everyone here is better than you at something.  In high school, you probably corrected your teachers all the time.  Don\'t do that shit here.  Sometimes they make mistakes in what they write on the board, but for the most part they\'re not wrong.  If you honestly think something is different from what they\'re saying, ask it as a question, don\'t tell them they\'re wrong.  Don\'t ask questions to make yourself seem smart.  Ask questions because you genuinely don\'t understand a point, or because you need clarification.  If it\'s more than a single point that you don\'t understand, don\'t waste everyone else\'s time, go in on your own to office hours or talk to a TA.  If it\'s a question that\'s relevant to no one but you, ask it after class or e-mail your professor.\n\nAlso, if you\'re going to be going out partying a lot, there\'s specific frat-related advice we can give.'",aWickedGangAreWe,6jzfr

He\'s very consistent with the type of questions he likes to ask and, since he\'s been teaching the class for how ever long, I\'d totally go with him since he clearly has a great system set up and won\'t be guessing his way through the semester.\n\nMy favorite Falzone anecdote: second semester I was studying for the first test.  I was super prepared, felt good about it and went to bed around 11:30.  5 hours later I was, for some reason, still not asleep.  I went to him the next morning before the test, explained the situation (didn\'t sleep, mind not functioning well...I felt like I was kinda pussing out but whatevs) and, before I could finish talking, he goes ""don\'t worry, take it another day; I\'m testing ability not sleep deprivation"".  Other students I\'ve talked to have had similar positive experiences with him.  If you take the initiative and go talk to him he\'s a great resource. \n\ntl;dr: falzone has an established curriculum that he\'s spent years developing that includes practice tests and years of teaching experience.  toscano --- who is this guy? maybe he\'s good, maybe not. falzone knows what he\'s doing in teaching orgo. also: falzone is just a nice guy in general if you put in the effort.'",nikhils_orange,5u97d

2shup,b'J-Card Mobile has a new look',x52q2,1343325312,c5jmibz,"b'Works just fine. \n\nDesign Suggestions (Android Version):\n\n1. The ""Back"" button on the bottom bar is redundant on Android devices since they all already have back buttons. Perhaps remove it and center the ""Logout"" button. For the ""Logout"" button, remove the power icon. It\'s an imagine traditionally associated with powering a device off and on and personally I don\'t find it applicable in software use cases. \n\n2. In the top bar instead of the Home button having a home icon and text, simply replace it with a large home icon and no text. Similar suggestion for the settings button. Instead of having a small settings icon and extraneous space next to it to make the button larger simply replace the entire thing with a larger gear icon. This would have the effect of making the top bar larger but since the J-Cash amount (or within a chosen category, the name of the category being browsed) is a key visual element, having it larger is actually a boon and shouldn\'t be an issue since there\'s sufficient white space below in most cases. \n\nBig change:\n\n3. Holo theme all the icons by flattening the top and bottom bars and their buttons as well as buttons within menu selections.\n\nBigger change:\n\n4. Holo theme the whole thing. I\'m just spitballing here, but instead of having a main menu maybe just be able to swipe left and right between the six categories?\n\nThat\'s all I\'ve got for now. But I\'m also not going to be using it actively for a while so I don\'t really have any usability complaints just yet. Again from a functional perspective it seems just fine and even design wise it looks nicer and is much better than before, but I like pretty things so I thought I suggest some changes. '",jhu,57uyu

Letsdrinktea seems to have a good grasp of the concept.  Typically if you\'re really interested in the honors version, I would recommend taking both simultaneously if you\'re able to that way you get both the ""applied"" version of the class as well as the theoretical version -- particularly as you can never have too much math.  \n\nThe Honors version of math classes can be more helpful for those thinking about graduate school for either math, engineering, or physics disciplines.  Taking one can also be useful for see how math is done at a higher and much more abstract level to see if graduate programs in these areas is really your cup of tea. \n\nAs for a more direct answer, you\'re likely to find fewer students in the ""honors"" version and therefore potentially more attention, but at the same time the professor is going to be expecting more ""mathematical maturity"" from you so you shouldn\'t expect a lot of hand-holding. If you are expecting hand-holding, I highly recommend that you search for and read some of Steven Zucker\'s philosophy about college level mathematics mastery.\n\nIf you call, email, tweet, or comment on Dr. Brown\'s blog or associated facebook page, I\'m sure he (or any of the other math faculty) would be happy to discuss the matter more extensively with you.'",chrisaldrich,3usmh

Thus, there is an absolute abundance of volunteering, shadowing and research opportunities all over if you have the initiative to search them out. As a freshmen, I got the opportunity to watch a surgery, and in a few days I may be watching another one (this one on a cadaver though, for research!) One of my close friends is premed, and she landed a spot in some crazy shadowing program on the med campus that had her on some insane night shifts kind of like a real residency. This also gives you plenty of options for staying in Baltimore over the summer and finding work on the med campus.\n\nThat being said, doing engineering + premed at the same time is not uncommon, but it is also not easy. Keep your options open though, and see if you really like engineering or if you'd much rather focus on life sciences. If it turns out you enjoy both, then go for it.

It's extremely easy to get sucked into the 'Hopkins bubble' because there are a lot of surrounding neighborhoods that aren't very safe. But Baltimore also has a lot of free/cheap public transportation, so checking out different areas is always fun (if you get on the right bus! I once got on a bus going in the wrong direction, ended up in the middle of nowhere 'last stop all off' sort of thing, sketchy as hell lol. But the drivers are nice and help you figure out where to go to get to the right bus XD).\n\nEngineering is boss but it's pretty freaking hard. I'd imagine it's hard pretty much anywhere you go, but still. Studying all the time definitely leaves something to be desired in terms of 'getting the full college experience'. The people in my program are what make it worth it though. Everyone's super helpful, group studying is extremely common, and we all bond in our misery <3. But you probably want to get other inputs on this since I'm particularly dumb so I need to spend extra time studying all the time compared to others. \n\nI chose Hopkins for BME, lawl. Oh! Also! Research is INCREDIBLY ABUNDANT here. That's a definite super ultra mega +1 if you're looking to get into some sort of undergraduate research. It's really pretty easy to find and get involved with, especially with all the work going on at the med campus (1 free busride away).

I can remember when this was attempted and perhaps can provide a little bit of insight here.  I was in the Buttered Niblets (improv comedy group), we practiced and held our shows in Arellano Theatre which was also in Levering.  So, I was in the building literally at least 10 nights per month.  And the entire group (~10 people) went months and months and months without knowing that this existed just one floor above us.  That is to say, no one really knew about it.\n\nThe actual contents of the room were not bad.  They had a bunch of TVs and even a few Xbox\'es.  They had a pool table and a ton of comfortable couches/chairs.  They had a lot of good snack food, including fried calamari (which one of the Niblets would get pretty consistently after we discovered its existence).\n\nBeyond just bad publication that this place even existed was just the location.  ""Location, location, location"" the old adage goes.  Well, Levering is not exactly conveniently located (or at least it wasn\'t in my day, I know there are a few extra buildings over on that end of the campus now).  This was a place that was meant to be an evening/weekend hangout when everyone would normally be in their dorms, but it was located as far away from the dorms as it could be basically.  I mean, yes, we were constantly in Arellano during these times, but I can vouch that for the most part Levering was very quiet.

2shup,b'Opinions on JHU',kxjif,1317804880,c2ox8pm,"b""**How do I like JHU?** I am definitely glad I am here. I do like a lot of things about this school, but of course it's far from perfect. I don't regret coming here, if that's what you're wondering. It can be a lot of hard work, and I am often stressed, but I find I generally work better under stress. There are definitely ways to take your stress out though. And by all means, you don't have to choose a path with more workload than you can handle. I still love all the opportunities that are available, I love the students, and I definitely feel that I am being prepared well for the real world. Definitely talk to other people to learn about more specific questions! (More than one opinion of course.)\n\n---\n\n**Social life?** You can definitely have a social life here. But you must find a balance between work and play. You may not get a stereotypical college experience, but only because everyone has their own unique experience. I have as much a social life as I want. TBH, (Junior here btw) the partying all the time and stuff gets old kinda quick. After a year or two, when your classes get more focused, you will probably (hopefully) enjoy the work you're doing and not feel tempted to rebel against the establishment. Covered grades during first semester are a great resource for beginning to determine your balance. As stated before, there are people who go out 4 nights a week and get by, and people who work all through the weekend, and don't go crazy. So you should be able to fit pretty well. (Life is not going to be perfect anywhere. I feel that the benefits of being at Hopkins outweigh the necessary sacrifices.) If you're wondering, there are plenty of parties; frats are usually open, and house/apartment parties are everywhere. You'll be able to go out when you want to. You can make friends if you put the effort in. As for extracurriculars, I would say choose 1, MAYBE 2 groups to be involved in. If you try to juggle a dozen clubs like people do in high school, you will fail. But this means you can be very involved in what you choose, and that looks better anyway to grad schools and employers. There's tons of clubs and organizations. You may have seen the post about the student union not working out, which is one thing I am sad about, but we've all been able to deal without it. (No school is perfect. There's always improvements to be made.\n\n---\n\n**Research opportunities?** So many opportunities... Only thing is, you need to seek them out yourself. Hopkins is not a hand-holding school. If you have questions, talk to your adviser. To find research, just look up some professors in your department (or not) and see whose research sounds interesting to you, shoot them an email. Email a bunch of professors, and you'll easily get at least some responses and offers. You can take it for credit (which they prefer) so they have some leverage over you, but honestly, it's a GPA booster. (Which you'll probably need. But don't worry, it's pretty well known everywhere that Hopkins has pretty bad grade deflation.) You can also take it pass/fail, or for money if you're lucky. I did research over the summer, which was very nice, and now am doing it during the semester. You definitely have a lot less time over the semester though, which I guess is obvious. But science and engineering departments are overflowing with research opportunities. Almost everyone I know in sciences or engineering have done or is doing research. It's pretty common. I should mention though, that you may get a research position where you are a lab monkey, or you may get a real opportunity to do your own research, so look around a lot and talk to people in the labs!\n\n---\n\n**Difficulty?** Some classes can be pretty hard, but you're not going to be busting your ass for every class you take for sure. In the beginning, you may find some classes seem almost too easy, but don't be fooled. They can turn around and get challenging. As for competition with students, don't be fooled by the rumors of how cutthroat we are. Students help each other all the time. You'll definitely be able to find friendly classmates. The only thing I might say, is that the Biology department seems to have a fair amount of Premed-weed-out classes (I got caught in the crossfire; I'm not premed) that can be fairly competitive. As for curves, it really varies across the school. Some classes curve the average to B- or C+, which is the low end. A few curve to A-. Most curve to B or B+. Just watch out for some. It of course depends on the professors and such, so ask and talk to people! Now, I do admit I had to lower my standards for grades here, which was not easy at first, but don't despair. You have lots of opportunities and time to pull up your GPA. You just need to adjust. It's a general thing about going to college. If you were in the top of your high school class, and you come to a school like Hopkins, you'll be surrounded by people who were also at the top. So now you may be in the middle. It's nothing to worry about. As long as you don't totally fuck up, you'll be set. Let's be honest, Hopkins's name is still a valuable resume tidbit. And as everyone I've ever talked to who's graduated and got jobs says, **YOUR GPA ONLY MATTERS FOR GETTING YOUR FIRST JOB!!** If you get internships or research, then it matters even less! Then after that, no employer ever gives a flying fuck what your GPA was. Maybe get a grad degree, and you're set even more. \n\n---\n\nBy the way, I'd just like to mention, currently there are several major construction projects going on here. \n\n* Gilman Hall just finished being remodeled and is absolutely beautiful. Great study space there, and a museum in the basement xD\n* Brody Learning Commons will be completed next year, which is an incredible looking new add-on to the library, dedicated to student group study space and collaboration, complete with lots of cool technology for us to use.\n* There's a new undergraduate labs building, probably going to be finished in 2 years, I think for chemistry and biology mostly, but that should be a cool opportunity for you especially if you're interested in research! Most labs are mainly for grad students, so this should provide some awesome space for undergrads and many more useful lab positions for you. \n\n---\n\nOverall, Hopkins is really a great place. You make it what you want it to be. You may have to put some effort into that, but it's totally worth it. People like to complain, but truthfully, most of us love being here. You may not be able to get an Animal House experience here, but once you go out into the real world after being at Hopkins, you'll be able to handle it easily.\n""",Sgt_Ice_Bucket,4tg7p

But, I think it's important to remember that isn't a boys' club of internet nerds bitching about not getting laid. \n\nSad part is that OP seems to be a reasonable person based on his comment history. \n\nAm I overreacting? Quite possibly. But the mods needs to decide now what the tone of this subreddit is going to be. Are we going to allow this and other kind of banter that targets specific groups (women, ethnicities) stand or will the banhammer come down? And more importantly what the criteria are to qualify for such action.\n\nIt may seem unnecessary when there's not much traffic and the subreddit is largely viewed by members of the larger Reddit community who happen to go to Hopkins but with plans to hopefully invite non-Reddit using members of the Hopkins population it's important to set rules for the days ahead. \n\nAt the very least it's something to think about.""",jhu,57uyu

I think Hopkins is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this. Most of the schools where you would imagine there are a large number of redditors: MIT, CalTech already have large subreddits with lots of people. \n\nGiven that r/jhu is fairly new and the school year hasn't started yet we have a very good chance of adding more people when the school year starts. It's worth a shot. At any rate, I think the mods should PM hueypriest to get Hopkins added to the list of college subreddits.""",jhu,57uyu

2shup,b'Advertising this subreddit',ix6dg,1311461706,c27gkk6,"b""I think everyone who +frontpaged this subreddit would love to have more participation. I do think there are important things to realize however:\n\na.\n\nIt's almost certain that the 32 readers used reddit long before r/jhu came into existence. I don't think appealing to Hopkins students who are redditors is going to be an issue. The challenge is approaching people who have no idea what reddit is and getting them to actively use the subreddit.\n\nb. \n\nI'm not sure flyers are the answer. This a website and I have no data on how successful flyer-based advertisement is in terms of driving web traffic, so I'm not qualified to say anything about it, but I think this needs to be driven organically. Friend looking over your shoulder, people looking for an alternative to jhuC, that kind of thing.\n\nc.\n\nFinally, I think this can wait till the semester starts. There's very few of us here at Hopkins now. In fact, I think we're outnumbered by CTY and other summer campish students right now. Let's just wait till the semester starts. We can send it around on Facebook, or even better, G+. See how people respond to it. Flyer based promotion can wait IMO.\n\nTL;DR Most of us already used reddit before. We need to think about people who don't know what it is. It'd be a good idea to wait till fall semester starts before thinking about promotion.\n\n\n\n""",jhu,57uyu
