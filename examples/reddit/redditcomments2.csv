Highly recommend the CV area if you're going to be near Homewood.  Hampden is popular, but if you have a car, parking can be a HUGE pain in the ass.  You can walk/bike easily from CV up to Hampden; I do it all of the time. \n\nIf you do decide CV, a row home is optimal.  The closer you get to Greenmount you get though the worst it gets.  Stay roughly around the Calvert/St. Paul area from above 29th street.  Remington is also up and coming and you can bike/walk from there.  There are some very good restaurants and cafes around Remington.  For Remington stay closer to Maryland Ave, East of Howard and above 26th-27th street.  \n\nIf you are going to work at JHMI I recommend anything in Canton, but below Patterson Park.  I used to live in Butcher's Hill and had my house broken into and my roommate had his car window smashed.  People will tell you Upper Fells, but it can be a mixed bag--people get robbed and assaulted (during all times of day--even while walking to work in the morning) alllllllllllllll the time around Fayette, Washington, Wolfe, and Caroline (below Orleans/Rt 40).  Anything really below the park is the safest option.  \n\nThe other popular option is Mt. Vernon, but I can't recommend it at all.  Parking is infinitely worse than Hampden and, I know this is my own opinion, but a lot of the stuff there (restaurants/bars/etc.) are completely overrated.  Plus rent is higher and it isn't always the safest.  People are constantly assaulted and accosted at gun point around Mt. Vernon.  If you have to get between both campuses the JHMI shuttle for Mt. Vernon can suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.  And that's an understatement.  The problem is Mt. Vernon gets screwed because they're sort of right in the middle, and during rush hour the shuttles are always full and constantly have to skip the Mt. Vernon people.

Common sense dictates this as well: If a terrorist wanted to actually cause damage to people/places/things, then why give people a warning of it? Why not just blow them up? Sure, the threat is too great to ignore, and at least one bomb threat has resulted in an attack, but look at this article (https://www.inlander.com/Bloglander/archives/2015/04/10/idle-threats-expert-says-bomb-threats-are-pretty-much-always-duds):\n\n> In talking to a colleague from the ATFE, I asked him how many bomb threats he had responded to over his 30-plus year-career, where he had found a real bomb and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cZero.\xe2\x80\x9d He has certainly discovered real bombs when called to the homes of bomb makers. He has found real and fake bombs when called by people who saw an odd-looking device on the ground, but again, real bombers bomb, they don\xe2\x80\x99t make bomb threats.\n\n- The timing. The timing is too perfect -- right before final exams, someone calls in a bomb threat. Really?

I have read varied reviews online I will sum it up here. \n\nInternet hear-say: \n\n- Some people say the program is running in easy mode because they know a lot of people who do it are fully employed and don't have much time. \n- Some have said that it's a decent program and you will get a education. \n- Some say since the degree earned is not the same, employers discount the degree. And don't look at it as a worthwhile education. Also, JHU lacks connection with the high-tech world, sadly Google and Microsoft are rarely there apparently (this is what I have read and take with pile of salt) \n- Some have said that the program is way too expensive for what it's worth and instead of spending money, people should try to get their employers to pay for it since JHU is not as highly ranked in CS and engineering. I have heard many people say that Georgia Tech is better and cheaper ($7,000 for the whole degree) but the program is really hard and could take longer to complete.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nI am in the same boat, I am looking for their CS program and am conflicted between the dirt cheap price of Georgia Tech VS high price of JHU. Google and other companies continuously hire from Georgia Tech, while JHU is mostly defense contractors looking for programmers and engineers for cheap. And their programs are mostly applied knowledge or vocational vs theoretical and rigorous. Lately I have been debating bridging from their online CS program to a PhD at a top 10 universities in the world. But the program is terminal and people have managed to bridge to a PhD, but it's very rare. I haven't found any alumni page or anything so I can ask them about the question that is bothering you too...so far mixed reviews is what I have had.

2shup,Any EE majors? What is your experience,66zcw0,1492951037.0,dgmptve,"b""I'll rattle off some of the pros of being a JHU ECE. I You will never worry about not being able to register for a class, as class sizes are pretty small. You'll probably get to know everyone in your class by the end of your second year. If you want to double in CS that's pretty easy to do, and a lot of ECE students do it. Our signal processing classes/research is world class. The JHU Applied Physics Lab, where many Hopkins ECE students intern and work, is world class. If you want to do research it's super easy to meet with professors (aside from a select few) and get started here, even as a freshman. We have a lounge with free coffee/printing. \n\nHowever, I will admit there is little to no help given by the department when it comes to providing internships/job opportunities. This is slightly due to faculty's preference for students to work in their labs over the summer instead, but it's mostly because they don't really care what underclassmen do. There is a career fair every semester (not hosted by ece) but it is geared towards internships in software, defense contractors, or consulting.\xc2\xa0\n\nThere are also serious flaws with the ECE curriculum here but there are some steps being taken to fix that (kind of). I personally feel like this isn't too big an issue because there is still a great amount of flexibility when it comes to choosing courses.\xc2\xa0\n\nYour best bet is to speak to upperclassmen about their experiences in this (and other) departments, but you will honestly be fine with whatever major your choose in the end.

Really just have to listen to lecture and memorize notes. He used to base his tests off of backtests, but when i took it he'd changed up the exam so it was different. It's an easy B, but you'll have to work to make sure you know the lectures well enough to score an A (when there's 40 q's on the exam, missing 5 q's is already an 88%) Shouldn't be too hard to get into since it's 400 ppl (depending on what year you are tho it might be)\n\n3) Positive psych - super fun and interesting class! Highly recommend, esp during a hard science heavy semester.

That has to include times for tests too, so you're looking at final + study days, and a midterm or 2 + study days, so the actual class time is super condensed. \n\n\nWhen I took it I believe classes were 1.5ish hours. The good thing is they basically have a microphone and lecture on a virtual whiteboard. So you can watch the replays of it later for efficient studying, or if you miss it. \n\nThe hard thing is they still make sure you know all the material that they normally reach over 9 weeks, so you'll have homework every other day probably. You'll also need to watch the class, then spend a couple of hours learning the concepts to ensure you have a good mastery. It's graded as harshly as a standard Hopkins math class, or maybe a bit easier but not much. \n\nIt's a good environment for getting a much better understanding of Lin alg, and the classes are smaller so you can ask questions and contact the professor directly.

Actually I would recommend taking any course online.\n\nMy DiffEQ course was taught by a couple of graduate students, who I felt were very effective at teaching the material and were also good at communicating with students in general. For example they were pretty lenient with credit on homeworks and exams, and were understanding about work turned in late. If grad students are teaching Lin Alg, I say go for it for sure. If not then see who's teaching during the school year and compare. \n\nThe biggest advantage of an online class is the online lectures. You can pause/rewind anytime you want and can watch them at your leisure. If you show up to lecture it's easy to ask questions and have a discussion on the online board. \n\nThe only thing Im unsure about is how condensed the teaching might have to be in order to cover all the material, but during the summer you'll probably have only like two or three classes/job to worry about so it's pretty hard to get behind.\n\nHope this helps.""",EpicCelloMan54,bqbhi

That being said, I  also have lived my whole life in Ithaca so a big reason for choosing Hopkins is that I wanted to experience somewhere else. And FYI, I was deciding between engineering at the two schools. I don't know what program you're interested but I can probably answer about a non engineering program too. I think that you really have to consider what your interests are and what you value. The biggest difference is going to be the location. If you're really really interested in outdoors adventures like skiing, hiking, mountain climbing, or just experiencing endless tracts of beautiful trails and wilderness, Cornell will offer that 10 fold. But, at the cost of being basically in the middle of nowhere with very limited transportation options if you don't have a car. One thing that I have loved about being here, is that not only does Baltimore offer a wide variety of opportunities, including many outdoors stuff, but I can easily go to D.C., NYC, or basically anywhere else on the east coast. I absolutely love Ithaca, but It can get old and one runs out of novel things to do. There are a lot of other things too. Cornell will have many of the benefits of a large school, and Hopkins will have many of the benefits of being on the smaller end (Cornell's expanding enrollment in fact).

2shup,Concerned about BME job prospects,60wr4d,1490250501.0,dfa64a8,"b""My 2 cents - really depends on the type of jobs we're talking about. If you're talking about jobs that require much of the specialized technical skills you'd get with an engineering degree, then it's a legitimate concern. But if you could also see yourself in jobs that don't strictly require engineering degrees (e.g., finance, consulting), then BME is perfectly fine; they'd just be looking for analytical and problem solving skills and comfort with quantitative stuff. \n\nThe benefit of BME is that you CAN do premed and still have good degree to fallback on. Because BME overlaps significantly more with premed requirements than other engineering degrees like EE or MechE. But at the same time, engineering degrees in general (including BME), have better job prospects than science majors. For the type of jobs where other engineering majors have an advantage over BME, a BME degree would still have an advantage over science majors like neuro / bio. \n\nSo going back to your concern, it's legitimate for certain career paths. But if you want both premed and engineering, BME is probably the best option. I can't say to what extent being BME makes it to maintain a top GPA for med school; my opinion would be it's much more difficult to maintain a top GPA. But for what it's worth all my BME friends ended up going to very good medical schools or didn't have much trouble finding jobs (to my knowledge). Part of this may be because BME at Hopkins is such a competitive program that it is generally comprised of very driven people with a certain tenacity.""",hungryhungryhippooo,86z7y
2shup,Concerned about BME job prospects,60wr4d,1490243795.0,dfa059w,"b""I'm currently a student here. Your concerns are certainly very real. I have had friends that were BME/premed going in, and all of them have dropped one or the other. I'm not saying both can't be done, because I'm sure it certainly has, but you're right, especially at a school like Hopkins where GPA is hard to maintain regardless of your major, having a competitive premed GPA while also majoring BME is difficult. \n\nI would add that a lot of students come to this school with premed aspirations, but find out that it just isn't for them. This doesn't mean they weren't able to do it, but rather that they found a different path that interested them more. My greatest advice would be to look into the requirements for graduating BME and for getting into med school, then give it a semester or two. If you are on track for both, then great! But if not, then take the time to reevaluate your priorities.\n\nAs for your question about the usefulness of a BME degree, I am not in the engineering school so my knowledge may be limited, however I have had 2 of my BME friends describe the BME learning experience as becoming a jack of all trades and master of none. They said to really get involved in BME you'd need to pursue it at the Masters or Doctoral level. One of those two friends recently dropped BME and switched to EE because he felt like he wasn't learning any focused skills. Once again, this is just word of mouth from my 2 friends, so I doubt it translates to all BMEs at this school. Congrats on getting accepted into the program. Although I'm speaking from inexperience, most of my engineering friends that have graduated told me that your job prospects mainly depend on how well you market your skills, how far you network yourself, and what internships you land. \n\nI hope these answers help.

If you put the word 'nano', 'micro', etc. etc. in front of something it sounds 'cool', but in reality the shit often never works because BMEs have very, very poor knowledge of basic science a lot of times.  \n\nFor example, I've seen graduate BMEs get frustrated that EDTA wasn't dissolving in water when trying to make buffers.

Names will not be named, but I also asked a BME if they used an assay to detect apoptosis after a treatment.....they recommended me to do a MTT assay.....WTF?  Holy shit, this person is getting a PhD from Johns Hopkins in BME?  There are so many BMEs that claim to know biology but have no clue how to do something so basic like a western blot, immuno precipitation, how to flox a gene, how design a primer for PCR and analyze the results on a DNA gel,  etc. etc....\n\nAnd I've seen BME undergrads forget what DNA does (but they can do stupid linear transformations using matrix algebra!) and I've seen BME undergrads not even know high school basics of acid base chemistry that is so, so ,soooooooooooo essential for molecular biology.  \n\nMost BMEs though are using it as a springboard to get into medical school or for working in the financial industry, which is fine I suppose.  But if you want to do this as a career, I am extremely doubtful.  You don't know enough engineering and definitely, definitely not enough experimental biology.  Nano- something sounds cool until you ask a real biologist who knows that 'EPR effects' for explaining why a tumor is uptaking nanoparticles is basically BS and that all of this nanoshit has so many off target and genotoxic effects that are often ignored.  \n\n\nIf you want to be a hardcore engineer that does some biology--ChemBE is badass.  If you want to do more biology with some tech thrown in--chemical biology is the way to go, they are much, much better at biology and basic science. """,_IDriveADodgeStratus,reffm

You have to be a MechE to get an aerospace concentration.

We also have a chapter of AIAA on campus, which was rebooted last spring.\n\nI interned at NASA after my junior year, and that was an incredible experience, and I know other people who did internships at Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, and a few other aero-related companies.

As for jobs, I can't help too much in that regard since I'm working on my Masters elsewhere, specifically in AE. \n\nHopkins definitely isn't particularly known for aerospace engineering, though I had a really great experience with the concentration. A few of the courses are taught by lecturers who work at APL and a couple other companies in the area, so it's really great in that regard to be taught by people who work in the field every day. At the end of the day, you're getting a mechanical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins, which is already worth a lot, plus some background in AE.

Basically the program changed a lot between my year and the year after me.\n\nWhen I joined you were required to do a thesis, everyone was funded and paid for, and the program took 2 years.  However, the fund that paid the Masters students ran out after my year so there is no more funding available.\n\nThe lack of funding for Masters is really standard across the US though.  Its very rare to be funded unless you go for a PhD.  If you want to talk about paying for it you are best asking a student in the year after me since I didn't pay for it myself.  But I think they did it like every other masters student: just get a student loan from a bank somewhere.\n\nAs for the classes, in my year we didn't take any classes to bring us up to speed.  My background was in mechanical engineering so I need a lot of help with biology stuff, but there were other masters students with backgrounds in biology who helped me.  And in turn I helped them with things like MATLAB and computer stuff.\n\nSo yeah, there is no prerequisite courses required if you are Masters student and you don't have time to take undergrad courses anyway.  Only courses above a certain level count towards the Masters degree requirement and there is a lot of courses to take in a year so you will be booked.\n\nSo yeah you will need to find friends to help with courses and you will need to find a loan to pay.  Although potentially there is some scholarships I'm not aware of (talk to someone the year ahead of you).\n\nBut in the end this is kind of the situation everywhere.  If you manage to find another Masters program that will pay you while you attend, you may want to seriously consider it, but Hopkins is a great school so I imagine it will still be worth it.\n\nHope that helps""",FreeRunningEngineer,eh5fq
2shup,Accepted for grad school - some questions,5z1hnu,1489402974.0,deutn5l,"b'I\'m studying ECE as a master\'s student this year and I did BME undergrad at Hopkins, so I know a handful of students who entered the BME MSE program this past fall; I\'ll do my best to answer, but I honestly don\'t know much about the funding situation.\n\nAs far as I know, most students don\'t need to take any extra classes that are typical \'prerequisites\' when they start. You\'re required to take two ""Systems Bioengineering"" (SBE) Courses (there are three available) regardless of the degree type that you go for. I took all three as an undergrad and I would say there aren\'t any prerequisites per se, but they all required use of MATLAB at some point, and I believe it\'s assumed that you have taken the basic math courses (Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Multivariable Calculus). I\'m not sure if you\'ve taken those, but I wouldn\'t be *too* worried if you hadn\'t. You\'ll have friends and you could catch up on the specific tools on your own time. SBE I and II are more related, and SBE III is its own thing entirely.\n\nThe rest of your courses just need to be 400 level or above (i.e. \'graduate\' level classes) and you\'ll likely have quite a lot of flexibility there. Even if you don\'t have a prerequisite for a certain class, if you\'re a graduate student especially, most professors will let you in regardless (not that that is a guarantee and I\'m sure there are some students who don\'t have that experience, but I\'ve never had any problems just emailing professors, explaining that I don\'t have the prereq, and being allowed in anyway). That said, it does depend a bit on the specific class, your background, and how much time you\'ll have to dedicate to it (if you are missing prereqs). Like if you try to jump into a 600 level CS class without any programming experience (for a computational biology concentration)...that\'ll likely be a struggle.\n\nPersonally, I think the master\'s is very doable in 3 semesters (I and a couple friends are completing ours in 2 semesters), which means that may be a little less money (not much...but still). I\'m not sure about BME MSE, but you can maybe ask about how part-time would work if you want to try to finish in two semesters, but you may have one or two courses left (so you basically pay per credit in the final semester, which could save you quite a bit of money). I know it\'s possible for ECE because I know someone doing that, but again, you\'ll want to ask the BME department.\n\nThere is a chance, if you get really involved in a lab and a project, that you could get some funding from the lab or a project grant, but that\'s a very big maybe (I have been paid a bit from a grant, but that\'s small fry compared to tuition), so I wanted to throw that out there, but I definitely wouldn\'t count on it. Honestly, I\'m not sure what else to say for staying afloat and not drowning in debt for grad school...the majority of people I know either are in debt, have their parents pay for it, or they worked for a couple years and saved up before going to grad school.\n\nSorry that was so long, but I hope it helped a bit.

I lived in the Varsity as an undergrad and that was a complete waste of money (tiny rooms, meh amenities, small kitchens, weird furniture, super overpriced, etc), and I've heard/seen that Nine East 33rd isn't that much better (though I admit I am very jealous of the location). \n\nI lived in the Guilford (note that it is different from Guilford Manor, which is just a block away) for a year and it was pretty nice, though it was a decently long way to walk. Pretty spacious rooms, usually large kitchens, etc. The downsides were that the AC units would only be able to be either hot or cold (the apartment building as a whole would switch at around the season change), and there's generally no laundry unit in the apartment (I might just be spoiled by the fact that I had one in the room for so long).\n\nHopkins House - I know quite a few people who have lived there, including professors and grad students. Honestly...I would avoid it, based on what I've heard. It's also, imo, quite far from campus in terms of walking (~25+ minutes walking, which would lead to...like more than an hour of walking around every day if you go back and forth more than once).\n\nUniOne - Have a handful of friends who live here, and they generally like it!  I've been to a couple apartments there, and they seem pretty spacious and nice, but the downside is that I think it really depends on who actually owns the apartment. I think it's really walkable too.\n\nMarylander - Another place I've been to tons and had friends who lived there last year. Okay apartment space, but they mostly hated the apartment because of the management and annoying things...like apparently they'll sometimes just tell you they're turning off water access for the majority of the day so you can't shower or use the toilet or anything? Maybe someone else who actually lived there can confirm, but I would personally avoid.\n\nI've never lived in a rowhome, but I have friends who spent a few years there and it's apparently very affordable and spacious, but could be more of a hassle (I think the appeal of a lot of apartments are that they kind of 'take care' of everything for you).

2shup,Freshman Housing Questions,5rhhvf,1486080804.0,dd8myjt,"b""Everyone posting in this thread is nuts. I lived in AMR II and wouldn't trade it for the world. Sure you have to share a bathroom, but I'm a senior now and live in a rowhouse with people from my AMR house. All of us were random roommates. I did not end up being good friends with the person I lived in a room with, but I did love my hall. We picked up friends along the way but by and large our freshman hallway is the locus of my friend group. Folks who lived in Wolman, McCoy, or Buildings A and B (I think they call them AMR III now) didn't get that and I think they really missed out. My order would be AMR II = AMR I > Wolman > McCoy > Buildings A and B. It is certainly possible to have a sociable floor in Wolman, but I think both the ceiling of sociability is lower and the floor higher than in the AMRs. I lived in McCoy sophomore year and didn't really like it very much. I still had to share a room and the kitchens were tiny and crappy. """,GrimTuesday,none
2shup,Freshman Housing Questions,5rhhvf,1486030312.0,dd7usmd,"b'strukbylightnin answered how the process works so ill just give more insight into each dorm\n\nAMR 1 and 2 are the traditional college dorm experience. Share a room with a roommate, share a bathroom with your floor. My friends that live here only complain about no AC in the first few weeks of school. Good things: you\'ll get the ""social"" aspect where people leave their doors open and people hang out in the hallways and you know people on your floor and interact with them. You\'re also very close to your classes, FFC (the main cafeteria), the rec center, etc. Cons: when I went on a tour here my tour guide\'s bathroom was on a different floor than his and that totally turned me off lol also I needed to have my own bathroom so if that\'s you don\'t go for it. Only good thing about their bathrooms is that they are cleaned for you. \n\nMcCoy and Wolman are pretty much the same except Wolman is a little newer. I live in McCoy. Suite style living with two rooms of two roomates with a shared kitchenette and bathroom. Pros: AC, your own bathroom, have a fridge and extra sink, you can cook basic stuff and have room to buy a microwave if you\'d like. Close to Charles Street Market (CharMar) where you can go for groceries or food in the morning. McCoy and Wolman also have amenities like a study room, gym, larger kitchen, and TV rooms/lounges. Wolman even has a movie theater in it although its hard to reserve. Cons: unless you have a floor where everyone particularly gets along you wont really have people hanging out in your common room or socializing like in AMR 1 and 2, people mostly keep to themselves. Personally my roommate and I are great friends so I really got lucky in that not really talking to people on my floor doesnt matter to me. I have a friend in Wolman whose floor always hangs out together and they go to movies with their RA and stuff but again I think it really depends on the people you live near if you\'re in McCoy or Wolman, whereas its much easier to facilitate being friends with your floormates in AMR1 and 2. The walk to campus in the mornings can also be a pain in the ass but you might as well get used to it as after freshman year you\'ll always have to cross the street to get to campus. It\'s only like 2-3 minutes anyways. You also have to clean your own bathroom, but my roomate and suitemates decided how we\'d divide tasks up so it actually stays clean and we do our dishes right after using them so its a great situation and i\'m quite happy in McCoy. I live on the terrace floor of McCoy (ground floor) which means no stairs, my room is a short walk from the entrance, and my laundry room is right across the hall from my room so I dont have to make a trip to do it and I can just go back to my room and do homework while its running instead of going up and down stairs/elevator to check on it. \n\nAMR 3 is like a ""best of both worlds"" type of situation. Right above the FFC, they have air conditioning, and the building is close to the rec center basically so they are in a great spot for getting everywhere, you have the roomate + 2 suitemate setup Wolman and McCoy have, minus the kitchenette. You have to clean your own bathroom in AMR3. However, this dorm doesn\'t have the amenities that Wolman and Mccoy have, and they only have one common room in their basement with a shitty TV and some couches. My friends there love the proximity of their living situation to everything around campus but sometimes wish they had the TV rooms and amenities of Wolman and McCoy as well as the social aspect of AMR 1 and 2. \n\nSo personally i\'d rank them Wolman, McCoy (Wolman is like a more modern version of McCoy) AMR3, AMR 2/1 mostly because I wanted my own bathroom and a suite and was willing to clean my own stuff. \n\nI would very much encourage you to look for a roommate. I really wouldn\'t advise going in random, as I have some friends that never really talk to their roommate/dislike them. The GroupMes you form over the summer/right now with other 2021 students are a great place to find someone you might be compatible with, that\'s how I found my roomate (in a smaller group of like 15 kids, not the huge one with everyone in it). I was looking for someone my age (I was 19 going into freshman year) with similar mindsets on partying, studying, and future plans. People that say ""I want to go in blind to be surprised"" or something are honestly not making a smart choice, because you don\'t really ""know"" this person but you have an idea of their compatibility, so I\'d really start thinking what kind of person you want to have similar values with and find that person or at least someone close to that. I\'m sure there are facebook groups with male/female roommate searches in addition to the My.jhu portal (at least there were last year) so i\'d start thinking about that. I did all of the things I\'m advising you to do and my roommate is my best friend here so it works out. \n\nAnother note about MEAL PLANS: As a freshman, you\'ll primarily be eating at the FFC (the cafeteria) with meal swipes, and you get a set amount of dining dollars to spend over the semester. Meal plans are unlimited meal swipes and like 180 DDollars, 19 meal swipes a week and around 250 DD or 14 swipes a week with alot more Ddollars. If you\'re living in the AMRs i\'d advise getting a plan with more meal swipes because you\'ll be in the FFC alot, as it\'s right by you. If you\'re going to be in McCoy or Wolman i\'d advise getting the 19 meal swipe one because going to CharMar for food is alot more appealing on a saturday or sunday morning instead of walking all the way to FFC, and you need dining dollars for that. You can change your meal plan after a few weeks so you have some time to test out whatever you choose though. You\'ll inevitably end up going to FFC less as the semester progresses though, so dont overestimate how many meal swipes you need. \n\nAsk me if you have any other questions! I\'m happy to help, as many of the questions I had weren\'t answered that well '",IMPERIALteig,ff4et

They say AMRs I and II are more social, but I think any dorm can be social or antisocial just depending on the people who live around you -- the people on my floor don't talk to each other all that much. I would say Wolman is the best, but it is really about how highly you value distance vs AC vs having to clean your own bathroom.\n4) Honestly no idea.

2shup,Anything about the Marylander?,5q4tes,1490239705.0,df9w9jn,"b""I am so passionate about how poor my residency at was at the Marylander that I made my first reddit account to respond to this post. One staple of my stay at the Marylander was shower water changing from scolding hot to ice cold. In one particular instance I was making deep passionate love to my then girlfriend. As things progressed I locked eyes with her as I was coming in from behind under the perfect lukewarm water necessary for the ideal shower back door penetration. Suddenly the shower began pouring boiling water onto our exposed bodies. This not only stopped me from putting it in her booty but also led me to suffer second to third degree burns all around my groin and lower stomach. I immediately jumped out of the shower and sprinted to MedStar Memorial Hospital where the doctor wrapped my penis in bandages and told me I couldn't be sexually active for the next six weeks to let my skin grow back. Sexually deprived after three weeks of no boning my girlfriend broke up with me to pursue someone who had a working lower half. Essentially, the Marylander's terrible water piping led my girlfriend of 4 years to break up with me after the fluctuating water burnt my hot dog worse than the FFC burns their burgers.\n\nAnother clear problem with the Marylander is the mold which they attempt to cover up with black paint. All apartments I saw had a layer of black paint where the wall meets the ceiling which upon close inspection proves to be a layer of mold covered in black paint. This is a cheap, low class tactic employed by their management and really reveals the type of people that run the Marylander.\n\nFinally, through the paper thin walls of the Marylander you can hear more disturbing things than in freshmen dorms at Towson. There is constant banging and pounding which either means the Marylander residents are running brothels or they all have basketball courts in their apartments. It would not surprise me if the Marylander mangers themselves were running these brothels, as they seem to have no problem breaking health laws or even any bit of human decency. The brothel would also explain why random men come in and out of the apartment at all hours.\n\nTLDR: Marylander showers caused my dick to burn off and girlfriend of 4 years to break up with me. They cover mold with paint. Management runs a brothel throughout the apartment.""",amswi2,16eqct

However, cause you spend lots of time focusing on pre-med class studying, you lose a lot of time you could spend studying for chem be classes. Personally, I think you should do neuroscience instead. It gives you a lot more opportunity to do other things around campus like extracurriculars and research. Not to mention, most of the chem be advisors here do not endorse premed and would rather you go into the industry. If you are really serious about premed, I would go with neuro, mcb, or public health (easy af); if you're serious about chem be, stick with it. I've heard the average gpa for chembes is below 3.0.

Every neighborhood is so distinct, the people in this city are overwhelmingly friendly and the city has a really fascinating history (War of 1812, Civil War, Civil Rights Movement and one of the country's biggest riots, etc.).

Excuse the long post.\n\n\n**1) What do BME majors do post graduation?**\n\nIn freshman year there is a class that brings in BME alumni once a week to talk about their careers post-graduation. The breakdown is roughly\n\n* 1/3 go to professional school (Med and Law)\n* 1/3 go to grad school for PhD or masters\n* 1/3 go into the workplace (big pharma, tech startups, medical device, consulting, etc.)\n\n\n**2) Will BME ""tank"" my GPA?**\n\nIn general, college will ""tank"" your GPA, especially at Hopkins. On top of your classes being more difficult, you will also need to adjust to living independently and perhaps new study skills.\nYes the BME major, like all engineering majors, requires many credits (129) and challenging classes (SBE I is a killer and rite of passage). However, please consider\n\n* Unless you AP out of general chem, physics, calculus, and have transfer credit for lin alg and diff eq, you are going to be taking these freshman/sophomore year. Most other engineering majors and science majors also take these classes.\n* Classes in the BME department are notoriously difficult, but they get curved very generously. My molecules and cells (BME version of biochem) class was curved to a B+/A-. The average was 76.5.\n\n\n**3) What is the best major for med school?**\n\nThere is none. I\'ve spoken with med school admissions staff who visit campus (one was on the board of AAMC) and they all say that the choice of major *does not matter* as long as you take all the necessary pre-med coursework (i.e. physics, orgo, biochem, bio, etc.). There are way too many pre-med students who have near perfect GPAs than there are spaces at med schools. Your strategy should be to do well in those classes (almost all of which are outside the BME department) so you can ace the MCAT, get research/clinical experience (med campus labs always welcome free labor), and demonstrate that you genuinely care about people (volunteering/community service is a must). Furthermore, you need to show that you are an interesting person who is committed to a life long career of nonstop learning. All of this can be done regardless of major.\n\n\nBME is a good fit for you if you like math or at least won\'t hate it when it shows up in your ""biology"" classes. There is a stronger emphasis on problem solving than on knowledge. My roommate is a pre-med neuroscience major and his classes are not easy either. Nervous systems I and II are taught by professors who also teach at the med campus. Around 20 pages of material are covered per lecture.\n\n\nThere is one *rumored* statistic about BME and med school success rates, but I have no way of verifying it. Apparently ~40% of hopkins undergrads who apply to med school get in. ~70% of BME\'s who apply to med school get in. It\'s possible that doing the major helps with admissions, but also equally likely is that the BME department\'s reputation attracts very strong students into the program in the first place.\n\n\nFeel free to ask me more questions. Being pre-med comes with a lot of information and misinformation that can\'t be fully addressed, even in this long post.\nYou should also be added to the class of 2021 fb group as well as the class of 2021 BME fb group.

2shup,"I'm considering applying to JHU, but I have a few questions first",5fx3ns,1480641538.0,dantjmf,"b""Current Student:\n\n1) Changing majors at Hopkins is extremely easy. You don't have to declare a major until the end of your freshman year as an engineer or the end of your sophomore year as an arts and sciences major. Many kids come undecided and it makes no difference to their college experience.\n\n2) Being somewhat conservative is fine. Any school you go to will have people challenging your beliefs but that's what college is about. You won't face any hostility.\n\n3) There is an option to take classes with the Peabody Conservatory of Music. For the most part, though, taking classes at other schools would only happen over the summer. You'll find Hopkins has most if not all of the classes you would want to take.\n\n4) There are distribution requirements for majors but they're not hard to get rid of. Engineers have to take a certain number of math classes, for example. I'm a neuroscience major and I'm required to take physics and chemistry and some math courses, but that's just so I can understand the upper-level material. There is a good amount of freedom in choosing classes. I'm allowed to choose which upper-level neuroscience courses I want to take based off a list of approved classes. My roommate's an economics major and he simply has to take a certain  number of econ courses but most are not required.\n\n5) The JHU community is very friends. It is a top tier college and people work very hard so we don't have the most school spirit but most students find their group(s) of people and are very happy. We have over 300+ clubs/organizations, so there's for sure multiple groups you'd enjoy.\n\n6) Dorms are pretty good. Sophomore housing is great. The food isn't bad. The freshman dining hall is a buffet style and it's pretty good. There are many options everyday.\n\n7) Not at all. Homewood campus is almost exclusively undergrads so you really don't feel any postgrad pressure.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any other questions.""",Toasteroven16,lyuls
2shup,"I'm considering applying to JHU, but I have a few questions first",5fx3ns,1480637696.0,danqc1f,"b'I\'ll a graduate student who didn\'t go here for undergrad but I figured I would answer what I could.\n\n1) Of the undergrads I\'ve talked to, switching majors seems just as common as any other undergrad.  Sure it may seem at first that everyone is pre-med destined since elementary for med school, but that doesn\'t mean there aren\'t options to change your mind.  The school has good career counseling services available.  However I will note that JHU is a small school and it seems most degrees are medically focused.  If you don\'t think focusing on human health is your thing, maybe consider elsewhere.\n\n2) You are going to face people challenging your views no matter what campus you go to, and not because your conservative but because college is a time for you to mature in your opinion and discuss them openly.  I have found JHU to be more cordial than my undergrad though.  I\'m more liberal and both the conservatives and liberals here have made well educated discussion here.  No one will be hostile unless you are hostile to them.  Yes we have safe spaces and affirmative action and things are general slanted liberal but its definitely not as extreme as my undergrad where protestors are out across campus and doing sit ins because there is a racial imbalance among the staff.  Here there are lots of open forums and efforts by the staff to have civil discussion.  It\'s nice.  But as always you don\'t have to be involved and most aren\'t.\n\n3) I don\'t know / doesn\'t apply to me\n\n4) I dont know / doesn\'t apply to me\n\n5) I would say JHU personality is ""busy"".  People all work hard and there isn\'t much free time or party life here.  Lots of people locked in study halls all day.  You will make plenty of friends but, again, this isn\'t a large school.\n\n6) the dorms are expensive and the food is awesome but also expensive.\n\n7) There is no emphasis on graduate education but in my experience you will get to have classes and work with grad students who will have a lot to add to your education.  I\'m only speaking from a biomedical engineering major though.  I\'m not sure about other majors'",FreeRunningEngineer,eh5fq

Otherwise, it's easy.\n\n2.) I am conservative, had no complaints during my time there.\n\n3.) Dual degrees are possible. I did BME (from the engineering college) and Neuroscience (arts & sciences). It was difficult, but doable.\n\n4.) Very few, that's why I liked it. As an engineer, I only had to take 18 humanities credits. It's different if you're pre-med, but that'll be the same everywhere.\n\n5.) Yes. Not sure how to describe the personality. You will most likely find your own group of friends and hang with them.\n\n6.) Dorms are ok, best is Wolman for freshmen and Charles Commons for sophomores. Rest are meh. Food was meh but it got better right after I graduated, apparently.\n\n7.) Depends. If you try to work in a lab, be careful of the lab that you pick.

2shup,I am a potential transfer student looking to come as a Junior next year. Any advice or comments from past transfers?,518iu2,1473133950.0,d7alzgs,"b""I was not a transfer-in and dif all four years at JHU. But, I'll try to address some of your points.\n\n1. Greek life is a fairly large part of the party social scene, but there are many many non-Greek clubs and organizations in which you can immerse yourself. But if you enjoying drinking and socializing, you'll need friends who are willing to leave the main Homewood campus area to head to the areas with lots of bars. Otherwise, it's house parties and frat parties. As a transfer in, you probably wouldn't be attending many frat or sorority parties anyway because you wouldn't know any members. But you've said that's something you'd like to get away from, so the bottom line is, if you make other friends, you'll be able to have plenty of fun without JHU Greek life.\n\n2. Living off campus is totally fine, with or without friends. There are lots of decent places to live near the main campus, and you'll make friends who you can go see on campus or off campus.\nOn a side note about living off campus, burglary is a real problem the farther from Homewood you go. It's not like you're  living in a bad neighborhood, but so many students live in the area and so many students have nice computers and TVs, so the area, in spite of proximity to the main campus (and all its attendant security), is a natural target for burglars. \n\n3. The honest answer is that it can be difficult to break into the Hopkins community at any stage. You have to want to make friends and be willing to work to make them because so many students are so driven and frankly less concerned with making friends. Personally, I think it has a lot to do with your major of choice and the kinds of people who choose respective majors as well as the rigor of your major. \n\n4. Only advice would be to really do your research about your major and your interests and see if they are reflected at Hopkins. Are there clubs you can join? Are there organizations and societies that interest you? How passionate are you about your major? Does Hopkins offer your major? If you don't like Greek life, the answers to these questions will lead you away from it and to people who share similar interests (aka friends). But, there's a good chance you'll have friends in Greek life. In my experience, it was more or less unavoidable to have some fun. But if you can tolerate a certain degree of Greek life and are an active outgoing person, you can have a lot of fun at JHU and can get a great (but damn expensive) degree as well.\n\nHope that helps and good luck. Feel free to PM me if you have specific questions in mind.""",Comogia,9bpbp

I think that as a junior, you'll find the social scene is not so Greek-centric as it is for freshmen/sophomores. Also, they have separate orientations for transfer students where they do a lot of things together so from what I've seen, they end up having a pretty tight-knit community. The downside to that is that some of the transfer students who were not as outgoing as others ended up just sticking to other transfers. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can limit your social circle. The Hopkins vibe is definitely very different from USC, so it may fit you better. Good luck!""",seryner,8yyr9

Any advice or comments from past transfers?,518iu2,1475588981.0,d8d7lmi,"b'I was a First Year Mentor for orientation this year and got to work with the transfer mentors as well (they were all transfer students). Here is what they shared with me. \n\n1) it will be difficult to adjust, especially socially. They mentioned how it was hard during the first semester to make friends and find their ""group"". You probably won\'t know anyone unless you already have friends here. \n\n2) Depending on where you\'re coming from, it may be a difficult academic transition. Depending on your major and classes, it can seem like your drowning in work. But don\'t freak out! It\'s a normal feeling and there\'s numerous resources you can use to help yourself improve. Learning den, pilot, office hours, TAs, just to name a few. \n\n3) Don\'t be afraid to talk to someone. It can be anyone - your RA, professor, a counselor, advisor, friend, classmate, anyone you can think of. While Hopkins is certainly a culture of its own, we are welcoming and look out for each other!\n\nThat said, here is my advice if you do transfer. 1) making friends is not hard because we don\'t like new people. Mainly it\'s because orientation is when you meet new people. However, I make new friends literally every week (not an exaggeration). You could be one of them! Join clubs, dance teams, study groups, sports! All of these will get you connected with people who might become your best friends. One of my great friends is a transfer. I didn\'t even know until we\'d been friends for a semester. So, there\'s hope :)\n\nAcademically, like I said. It\'s challenging. But, don\'t let that discourage you. I\'m always inspired by my classmates to push myself to my best ability (although I\'m on reddit and have a midterm tomorrow lol). And I use many of the resources available to be a successful student. (You define your own goals and your own success, not other people). \n\nAnd if you need someone to talk to, your transfer mentor and RA will probably be your first contact. And then anyone else you meet. Feel free to reach out to them or me. \n\nI hope this helps! Sorry if it sounds a bit blunt, but I didn\'t want to sugarcoat it. But, I can promise if you do come here, you will make it through and will make great friends (just takes a bit of time haha).

2shup,Advice for a CS Freshman,4zgll1,1472226304.0,d6x8u07,"b""I need more specific information to give you class recommendations, like what other classes you want to take and what your CS experience is.\n\nIn terms of time management, start everything as early as possible! You'll probably hear this a lot, but it is absolutely imperative that you do this. It gives you tons of time to think stuff out if you run into bugs and more time to thoroughly test your code. Most importantly, you'll be able to ask your professors questions early on, and not when they're being bombarded by questions from everyone else like two days before it's due. If needed, you might even have time to completely refactor, which I did a lot in Data Structures. I was one of the very few people who actually started early on things (I am by no means bragging, but really, NO ONE starts early on things and it always kills them lol) and it has really shown in my performance relative to the curve, so to speak. I am definitely not a very smart individual or anything like that, but working consistently over a long period of time as soon as the assignment is given really gives you a leg up because you can code cleanly and carefully with a good understanding of what you're doing.\n\nAnother important thing is to design your code. If you ever take a class with Amir, he will really show you the importance of this. Have a plan for how you want your code to work, and how it will be broken up to accomplish what needs to be accomplished. Code organization is important! Many people will tell you otherwise or blow off design docs, but this is bad in the long run and will make you dig yourself into a lot of holes when things become complex.\n\nKeep your functions concise, as in each function should literally be just that\xe2\x80\x94function to do one thing. In object-oriented languages, do this with your classes as well. Keeping code minimal maximizes code efficiency, since you can reuse a lot of code by calling the small functions you've written. This will come up a lot in Intermediate and Data Structures.\n\nThose are the most important things, I think. Also read Effective Java, this will help you impress people in internships like A LOT. (Source: I wish so badly that I had read it before my internship this summer instead of procrastinating it since 11th grade lol.)\n\nI hope this helps!""",parkourdeer,qo1k5

2shup,Calc3 or DiffEQ?,4yqj4a,1471757509.0,d6ptvyv,"b""**TL;DR:** If you want to have a better foundation, I think you should take Calc 3 first. In my experience, Diff EQ is easier and more about memorization, Calc 3 is more about learning. Diff EQ may make you faster at solving very specific kinds of problems, but Calc 3 will help you understand what you're doing.\n\nI would say that Calc 3 is more fundamental than Diff EQ is. I took Calc 3 the last fall and Diff EQ in spring. Both are relatively easy, despite the fact that I didn't have a very good professor for Diff EQ (one could argue for either, actually, since everyone else seemed to dislike my Calc 3 professor).\n\nI personally don't know much about the classes you're taking, but Calc 3 teaches you the general math that you need to know to understand the stuff taught in Diff EQ, though you really only *need* Calc 2 since Diff EQ (at least when I took it) was mostly about memorizing formulas. (Also, I would highly rec taking Linear Algebra before/while taking Diff EQ.) Calc 3 will help you understand those things and I would consider it much more important to any science class or application than Diff EQ just because you'd be able to understand what you're doing better. Also, Diff EQ is slightly easier (although this may be because I took Calc 3 first), so it might be good to take Diff EQ with those courses just so you can learn Calc 3 better. That being said, Diff EQ does help a lot with recognizing different formats of differential equations that you may need to find solutions to in those classes, and might make you faster at identifying and solving the equations that show up in your classes.""",parkourdeer,qo1k5
2shup,Calc3 or DiffEQ?,4yqj4a,1471782906.0,d6q92zn,"b'Ok, so I have a bit of a differing opinion. I took the sequence in the usual order people take it (calc 3 -> linalg -> diffeq) and i\'m not a chembe, but as a bme i have taken other similar engineering classes (systems, models and simulations, etc). From my experience using math in engineering classes, most of what you need from calc 3 (emphasis on in the context of ENGINEERING classes, obviously not pure math and stuff) is how to take partial derivatives, which you can literally learn in two days. The hard, interesting parts of calc 3 (green\'s theorem, stokes\' theorem) which parkourdeer i think is talking about are also less applicable to engineering classes and more of theoretical note. \n\nConversely, even though diffeq may be ""easier"", I literally used differential equations everywhere in my engineering classes, from the first month of material to the last (for example, i\'ve used it on applications ranging from fourier transforms, stability evaluations, models of drug flow, spring/dashpot movements (lol)). In engineering, you\'ll eventually realize that differential equations are merely a (vital!) tool to help you obtain deeper insights, much like i\'m sure derivation felt like a ""tool"" to help you solve more interesting problems in calc BC. You\'ll later see that in your chembe classes, the hard part is getting *to* the differential equation, rather than solving the equation itself.\n\nIn the context of your particular situation, i\'d suggest taking diffeq first, because it\'ll be way more of a struggle to pick up those techniques on the fly than to learn how to do partials which is probably most of the knowledge from calc 3 you\'ll need in the class where calc3 is a prereq.'",multipless,sq9ky

2shup,Soph Fall schedule,4yf73d,1471595046.0,d6ne808,"b""Biochem can be a bit of a pain, just a lot of crap to memorize. When I took it, you're lowest midterm grade was dropped, including the final which was weighted like a midterm. This means if you do well enough during the semester, you don't need to take the final. So potentially not having a final for that class is something too look forward too.\n\nDiff Eq I had a terrible professor for. I also took it in high school and the course was almost exactly like my high school class, so personally I had no trouble in the class. For those reasons, I'm probably not the best judge on the difficulty of this class, but if you're a decent math student, then you'll be fine. My professor also worked 100% off the textbook so the majority of the class didn't even attend lecture. But that'll likely not be the case for you and especially for the first couple weeks I'd suggest attending class no matter what.\n\nPhysics wasn't so bad in my opinion. But it all really depends on how comfortable you are with the stuff. Again, I took it in high school. Physics Lab though is definitely easy to do well in for anyone. Also, there's practically 0 time you need to spend outside the lab doing any work for the class, it's all in-class.\n\nDon't know anything about Spanish, have you taken Spanish in high school? If you already know a bit, I'm sure it'll be easier, no idea on workload or anything like that though.\n\nInto Psych is a traditionally easy course because they used the same exams year after year and everyone had back tests. I heard last year that they actually changed the exams which messed up a lot of people. I would guess that if you can get the back tests from the most recent year you'll be good to go, but even if you properly study for the class, I don't imagine it'll be too terrible. Haven't taken it myself, but even my friends who took it last year after they changed the tests said it wasn't so bad. I think this course may also be offered in the spring, or maybe that's just Intro Soc, I can't remember. If you really need it for the MCAT, then so be it, but it's not a med school req, just recommended at some places and you can always self study it for the exam. That's really up to you though, whatever you're most comfortable with. I would recommend this as the first course to consider dropping if you need to.\n\nIntro AMS I also don't know much about. But if you want to be an AMS major, then this is obviously a required course that you can't put off a year. If it's also offered in the spring, then you'll have to look ahead at when the upper level AMS courses are offered and see if that makes sense to do. Probably best to take it now no matter what.\n\nI think you'll be fine with this workload. Biochem will be a bit of a pain, especially in the days leading up to an exam, but Diff Eq and Physics shouldn't be so bad if you have a solid math background/mindset. Psych a tossup, and I don't know about Spanish or AMS. The good thing about Hopkins is how late the drop date is, so stick with it for a bit and see how it goes.""",DatBlizzard,9ktyk

I would say that if you can take Intermediate with Amir in the semester you're planning to take it and you're the type of person who's up for a challenge and for learning more, then take Intermediate first. It will make DS super easy!

If you wanted a group chat where all we discuss are Hopkins related things, like the time for move in and the best computer to buy for BME, then you may have been disappointed. Although the big ""Hopkins 2020"" groupme does have a lot of conversation about things to do solely with Hopkins, there are also some (dare I say bonus) conversations that also come, from some ~interesting~ memes (though if you\'re on Reddit I\'m surprised you\'re even talking about said memes, since most of them come from here anyhow) to hour long conversations about Pokemon Go. \n\nSo I understand you, OP, if you mean that you are frustrated by friends talking to each other instead of only posting things of extreme relevancy to Hopkins itself. However, I do believe that your post insinuates that you have felt personally affronted by things written there, saying that some conversations are ""just not right"" and that the administration should shut down the service. I don\'t think it\'s ridiculous to ask what we may have done to have offended you. What, specifically, are things that we\'ve said that are ""not right""? I think you owe us an explanation before you urge anyone to shut down our communication.\n\nFinally, I\'d just like to touch on my own experience on the chat. Similar to the fantastic @jhucogsci, I have also made countless friends as a direct product of being in the big chat. Although I didn\'t join until 4 months after I got in, I have enjoyed being in it for nearly 100% of the time that I have. I\'ve learned a lot, not only about how big rooms are and how tremendously expensive laundry is (if you\'re gonna be asking the administration for any more favours, how about you tell them to make prices for necessary things less egregious!!1!1!) but also about my classmates. Sure, I don\'t like all of them, and even the ones I do like occasionally get on my nerves. But honey, if you can\'t handle people talking with their friends in a group chat, you\'ve got a big storm coming. Leave if you want, if you don\'t want just mute it, or confront us if you want us to actually change the way we\'re acting if it\'s making you uncomfortable. Just don\'t hide behind the anonymity of Reddit, post vague subposts, and claim that you\'re doing the ""right thing"" without saying anything to back up your claims.

You can always say something for people to consider and then leave it to them to think about it. If they listen then that's great, and if they don't at least you tried!\n\nEDIT: Just want to clarify that I have opinions and I think some opinions are gross but I don't think people shouldn't have a right to express those opinions/have to have the same opinion as me. Just think that sometimes things don't feel open to discussion at Hopkins, which I'm not really accustomed to, and that I can encourage someone to try and open that discussion.""",parkourdeer,qo1k5

If you're not, definitely take applied chem so you can get it done in a semester and use the second to take something more interesting (you can basically think of it as chem condensed into a semester). If you are premed, take intro chem 1, as you'll need 2 semesters of inorganic chem to fulfill your premed requirements anyway, and you wouldn't want some upper level inorganic chem course to potentially wreak havoc on your GPA.\n\nWRT physics, it doesn't really matter; I took regular physics 1 and AL physics 2 and both were fine, with slight preference towards AL due to the smaller-sized rooms (I think they give the same exams, actually). \n\nI think applicable credits are automatically applied to your transcript, so no need to worry 'bout that.\n\nWRT electives, popular (but imho boring) ones are IFP (intro to fiction & poetry) and expos. TBH i'd suggest going with your interests and choosing something out there and niche, preferably with a small class size b/c the rest of your classes will be lecture. You like latin?

You want a survey of american lit, go on coursera or something. I think taking interesting and different H/S classes makes people more interesting. \n\nBut if you'd like the easy A (read: if you're premed), do IFP or expos and you'll get at least an A- pretty easily.

You have the option of writing a senior thesis and everything. \n\nBottom line: I can't say enough good things about the biophysics department. I think my experience at hopkins would've been a lot different and less pleasant if i hadn't switched into the major. Met some of my best friends there, found a fantastic role model in Karen Fleming.

Admittedly it was a function of how the dorm was laid out, the lack of common areas or large open spaces resulted in most people in my hall leaving their doors open most of the time, and people filtered in and out of rooms whenever they wanted (you could just close your door if you wanted privacy). The trade-off is that you have communal bathrooms, and older dorm, and no suite or amenities that come with that. \n\nWolman is a newer building, and there are some benefits to the suite layout. My friends who lived there said it was also pretty social since people tended to gather in the floor common area, but you have to try a little harder to bring that together. I think the rooms were very marginally smaller. It's a little further from where most classes are held, but a little closer to N.

The living conditions are a lot better than AMRs.

Get started in courses that require a sequence this includes Physics which is a required before you can move on to statics or fluid mechanics, Chemistry which is required before you can move on to actual Environmental Engineering Courses, and four required math courses Calc I, Calc II, Calc III, and Diffeq/Linear Algebra.

I had to make a very similar decision before I went to college, but for me, it was an easy decision. UVA was in-state, but I knew JHU would be a better school, especially for CS and engineering in general.\n\nThe real reason I went to JHU was because of the experience I had at SOHOP. My host was/is an amazing, nice, and welcoming person, and after meeting some of his friends during SOHOP I immediately knew that there would be a place for me at JHU.\n\nI've also visited UVA numerous times while attending JHU, because my girlfriend goes there. While I've had fun at both JHU and UVA, they are definitely different in terms of social life. Here are some pros and cons of both school's social settings:\n\nJHU\nPros:\n-Small school means higher chance of encountering people you know at parties\n-Plenty of groups/clubs to join, almost all of which hold some sort of party/celebration/formal\n-Small campus means most parties are within walking distance\n-VERY wide range of people/students\n-Don't need a fake (unless you want to go to bars)\n-President's pond\n-Spring Fair (very relaxing and chill, best time of the year)\n\nCons:\n-Some RAs will bust you if you're not careful (not really something to worry about unless you're going to be loud all the time)\n-Some parties run the risk of noise complaints, which involves some sort of fine I believe. This happened to my aforementioned SOHOP host, but he started a GoFundMe and made enough money back to pay off the fine. This can also be avoided by registering your party with JHU somehow? I'm not sure what it entails but I do know it's kind of a process, but if you do it only HopCops will respond to noise complaints, not BCPD. Also, JHU will give you water and animal crackers or something like that.\n\nUVA\nPros:\n-Big school, you will meet someone new every night (personally I'm not a huge fan of this; most of the time I meet someone while I'm out that ends up being the only interaction I have with them)\n-Parties will basically never get shut down\n-Even more groups/clubs with more people in them\n-Block Party (I've never seen throngs of people so large in my entire life. Very easy to lose the people you came with, although it's an awesome experience)\n-The Lawn\n\nCons:\n-Whenever I visit it feels like I only ever see white people. Which is fine, I'm white too, but it's a little disconcerting coming from somewhere like JHU\n-People rarely made an effort to get to know me at parties. At JHU, my friends made an effort to get to know my girlfriend when she visited, so I thought it was a little strange.\n-You will need a fake. Everyone goes to bars, it's ridiculous. Trinity (a bar) is hook-up central, and is where most people go to end their night at UVA. This is probably a plus. I don't think JHU has an equivalent to this that I know of (it definitely used to though).\n-Going out/getting home can be annoying because the campus is so large. You may have to use public transportation/Uber.\n\n\nI'm sure I could add more to these lists, but that's all I can think of right now. I'm also probably biased towards JHU, but there's a reason for that.\n\nI hope this helps with your decision!""",intricatehetero,66ap1

2shup,Electrical engineering at jhu,47duj8,1457018760.0,d0lsgop,"b""Kind of late, but I'll say a few things about my major since no one's really said anything substantial.\n\nNowhere near as popular as BME, ChemBE, or any of the bio majors here at JHU, the ECE department is one of the smallest, both in size and in funding. The school's not renowned for its Electrical Engineering prowess. You probably already know this.\n\nBut being a small department actually does have its advantages. Im a sophomore and my classes have already gotten down to like 15 students total. Signals, which is a class required for the major (so it has basically all the sophomore ECE's) is around 25 students in size. The professors are also pretty chill (imo) and easy to reach. Well, I guess that's not really exclusive to our department. But it's definitely a lot more casual being in an ECE class where there aren't several dozens of other students the professor needs to keep track of. Like if you want to do research as a freshman it's super easy to just email a professor and get going right away. Barton Hall is also going through some renovations; they're doing some major stuff out front and they just added a new optics lab along with the lounge remodeling. Did I mention that we have a kickass lounge? Other departments have like a couple of couches in the corner of the top floor of their building. I think only CS student lab can compare. There's always students chilling there, impossible not to make friends with all the other ECE peeps. Actually I'll also say that JHU's small size is a definite advantage over all the schools you listed (except MIT I think). Our engineering program is also *super* flexible. My friends at large state schools complain about trying to switch majors or having to take a required class at 8PM or something. But literally all you need to switch majors here is to fill out a slip of paper. Humanities/SocialScience requirements are also pretty lax. \n\nIf you make an objective comparison you'll probably find that MIT and Cornell are clearly better than JHU in ECE. Purdue and GATech may also be ranked higher in engineering? I dont think they carry the same name recognition as JHU though, since we're 10th (?) overall and get the most funding in research. And these public schools are like 5 times larger too. \n\nYou should get in contact with an upperclassmen if you want a more experienced perspective. But I will say I don't at all regret my decision to come here. In the end it's not *really* that big a deal what school you go to for a specific major. If you try hard enough you'll find opportunities to succeed no matter where you go. The best thing you can do is pick the right school based on location, size, campus, and other preferences.""",EpicCelloMan54,bqbhi

2shup,How the hell do I look for off-campus housing?!?,45yg2u,1455597536.0,d011pxy,"b""Hi there,\n\nWhen we were looking for housing we used several resources, but ultimately ended up 'taking over' someone else's lease.  In my experience this is the most common way to get a house because the market is competitive and usually houses have a lineage through some on campus organization and are passed from member to member.  Usually knowing upperclassmen who are graduating gives you an 'in' and they just tell their landlords that they have new tenants lined up, and there isn't much searching.  Not everyone has this option though, and so here are a couple resources we were looking into before we got our house:\n\n* JHU housing and dinning website had some resources\n* JHU housing and dinning semminar/presentation\n* Searching for management companies in the area (I know American Management is a big one)\n* Zillow might give you some ideas\n* Knocking on doors of houses that you know students live in (even if you don't know the students) and asking if they are moving out and if you and your friends can take over their lease\n\nAll of that is if you are trying to find a house.  If you are trying to rent I recomend contacting the apartment buildings in the area you want to live and asking.  If you think about it you can probably name the buildings, just google the name, find a phone number, and call the management company for information.  Off the top of my head I will list the buildings I remember: \n\n* Cresmont Lofts\n* Village Lofts\n* The Telephone Building\n* Wyman Towers\n* The Blackstone\n* The Charles\n* The Guilford\n* The Varsity\n* Uni One\n* The Marylander\n* Uni West\n* Hop House\n* The Carlton\n\nI hope this information gets you on the right track, I can be more specific if you can give us a little more information:\n\n* House or apartment?\n* How many people do you want to live with?  How many of those do you already know (ie is there a group you want to live with or just you, and if you have 2-3 do you want to be matched with 1-3  more?)\n* Where do you want to live?\n* How much do you want to pay?""",GHOST6,9at64

Most college kids try to find housing 5-6 months before they expect to move in, but other people generally make moves within a much smaller time frame so it's likely that spaces will open up around this time.

2shup,"Accepted for JHU 2020, any tips?",3wm1e6,1450047598.0,cxxi6b0,"b""Don't have a life plan locked in your mind during your freshman year. After my first semester I decided I didn't want to go to medical school anymore. I then spent almost the rest of college planning on getting a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, but just graduated in May without applying to any PhD programs and now I'm planning on getting into medtech design. Plans change, and it's not the end of the world if they do.\n\nAsk upperclassmen in your major for advice to see what mistakes they made that you can avoid.\n\nDon't date in your first semester, maybe even your first year. You will meet a ton of people in that first year.\n\nDon't let your grade define your self-worth. This is very common since a ton of people are trying to maximize their GPAs to get into medical school. I'm not saying don't try your hardest, but don't let it mean so much to you that it starts to affect your mental health and you as a person.\n\nIn a similar vein, don't let school prevent you from making good friends. I'm not sure if covered grades are still a thing, but if they are, use your first semester to get involved in student groups, make lasting friends, and enjoy college life.\n\nHOWEVER, still study your freshman fall! I didn't really study until college, then didn't study fall semester, then got worse grades than I should have in my freshman spring because I didn't learn how to study when I had covered grades. It's a skill that is different from high school that you need to acquire early.\n\nWhen making friends, this is a time to redefine yourself if you want to. Were you really shy in high school, like me? Just realize that everyone here is new and nobody knows you; just talk to people and make friends, they are just as nervous for you. Were you a slacker in high school? Ask people to study with you here, get a group around you that helps you maintain good study habits. Be exactly who you want to be on day one.\n\nSleep.\n\nLastly, if you think of this as the best 4 years of your life, you are just going to be disappointed when you graduate. Sure you can have a heck of a lot of fun and make lasting memories and friends, but think of all the cool shit you'll be able to do after graduation. You'll have money, you can travel, you can try different careers, get married, so much stuff. So enjoy this and make it fun, but don't have the mindset that your level or enjoyment of life is peaking so early.\n\nOK one more thing that I want to reiterate. Don't let grades define you. Don't high mental health disorders, and don't rationalize having them, especially the sort of depression that people can get at Hopkins. If you start to suffer, tell someone.\n""",CrypticParagon,8qq4c

I currently work at APL, but never interned there as a student.\n\n1. I applied ED without ever visiting the school.  My parents didn't have very much money, so the option of visiting schools was off the table.  I came from the Midwest, and holy crap the east coast was very different.  I lived in a very antisocial living situation my first year and struggled to make friends in the beginning.  My first 6-7 months at JHU were miserable, but things got better.\n\n2.  I got a good scholarship package, but holy crap the school is expensive.  I really don't think it's worth the $60k+ price tag.  At least in my field coming from JHU doesn't get you anymore recognition.  Not really a regret, but if I came out of school with $100k or more in loans I would be miserable right now.\n\n3. I worked in admissions for 3 years, so I have some insight here, but nobody can tell you how to get in.  I slacked off in high school some because I was really unmotivated, and I hated the environment.  I think my saving grace was I took my final year of courses at the local university (not community college, admissions views these things differently.)  I ended up taking university math, biology, physics, french, and some history of science courses.  I think that showed I was really dedicated and willing to push myself.  If you are applying for a hard science or engineering you really need to take the highest level in those subjects your school offers.  In addition, you should also stay well rounded so take a language, AP history, or music classes if you can.  If your state offers free post secondary education at your local university, do it! It was completely free for me, and it really helped me prepare for university level course work.  Lastly, work hard on your essays.  Don't write anything trite or cliche.  Spend a lot of time thinking about what makes you unique and differently.  Seriously, spend time thinking about it a lot so you know what you can highlight in your essay.  Great essays are important.  \n\n4.  I was interested in cell engineering.  They had a pretty specific program for that, where as many other schools didn't.  \n\n5.  I was in both.  There is literally no difference, except what your diploma says.  Maybe you need to take a few more credits to graduate depending on your engineering degree?  Either way, engineering students take classes in the arts and sciences, and arts and sciences student can take classes in the engineering school.  However, I should point out that the math degree is a BA, not a BS so it is not science intensive.  Applied math is in the engineering school, so it is a BS.  Lots of people double major with pure math, ie physics and math, chem and math, EE and math, etc.  Mostly, physics and math though.  \n\n6.  Always worth a shot.  Professors are busy.  Some just won't give you the time of day, and others are really eager to help interested students out.  It varies a lot.  Only downside is since you're only in HS, it is hard to come up with projects at the HS level for interns.  \n\n7.  A lot of my socializing revolved around hanging out at the library with peers doing homework.  I didn't have very much free time. It kind of bewilders me now how I survived with so little sleep.

2shup,Questions for Current Students/Alumni,3s7onz,1447805343.0,cx3dqoc,"b""Just graduated with a PhD in physics.  I can't offer a perspective on the total undergraduate experience, but I can't, in retrospect, say many good things about this place.  As far as physics is concerned, the undergraduate curriculum is laughably terrible.  What nets you a BS here wouldn't get you a BA at my alma mater.  This is because the registrar wants students to be able to *triple major*, which, frankly, is ludicrous, and so it suppresses the number of requirements for a specific major.  The research front is strong enough if you're wanting to enter a PhD program for experimental physics, but don't expect to have a good research or course experience without significantly more work on your own than at other institutes if you're jonesing to work on the theory side or bail after the BS.  The comp sci department here is great, but the math department is downright terrible for undergrads.  I think also about 60-70% of the undergrads are pre-med, which comes with exactly the mentality you'd expect.""",geodesic42,4xas9

Be specific like ""I\'m a BME and Dr. X is a personal hero of mine because I used to not be able to cry and thanks to his revolutionary thingamagig I can cry now. Yay.""\n\nIn general, when preparing an application, students are told to make it tell a story or to have an overarching theme. For you, given your TAship and tutoring, that\'s probably something to do with teaching so have your letter writers speak to that skill and then somehow find the room to talk about that in your little ""essay"", too. \n\nI haven\'t had coffee yet so hopefully this all makes sense.

Technically the US government owns the land around the Grand Canyon (clearly the government has more culpability for what happens on this land than Hopkins did for the fraternity house). Suppose that someone was pushed off of the side by someone unaffiliated with the park. After surviving the fall and sustaining massive injuries, the victim sues both the assailant and the park (for negligence).

No. Is it the park's responsibility to install potentially destructive guard rails?

I added CS back in sophomore year. I really like it-- I started taking a few CS classes because I was interested in programming and then decided to go ahead and add the major. \n\nGranted, I really like to program. If you like programming, you'll enjoy at least that aspect of the classes-- with the exception of the theory courses basically every class probably involves programming *somehow*.\n\nI can't speak to internships/research because I do that sort of thing over in physics, or the CIS program, but:\n\nThe core curriculum is very small: there are only like five or six required courses, but you are required to take a *lot* (42 if doing the BS, 36 if doing the BA I think) CS credits to graduate. There are lots of electives, so you can basically take whatever you're interested in. This flexibility is really nice.\n\nAs /u/ModWilliam/ says, the new CS building (Malone Hall) is really nice and brand new. [Enrollment statistics](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/undergraduate-studies/program-tracks/) are here-- the program may be small but it's definitely been getting larger. The CS department recently hired a bunch of new faculty while expanding into their new building too.\n\nThe (first floor) ugrad lab is pretty nice-- I personally *don't* usually work there, unless I'm working with other people in a group or something. There's also the (third floor) ugrad lab, which is generally a lot emptier and maybe a better place to focus on getting work done? \n\nI'd also like to plug the [JHU ACM](https://www.acm.jhu.edu/)-- I'm biased, but despite the status of our website, we're a good resource and we have a largeish office on the ground floor of Malone that's a nice space to work or hang out in addition to the ugrad labs.\n\nHope some of that was useful. :)""",TC01,8vr8k

Although I realize I'm a STEM guy I think I might be able to give you some interesting perspective.\n\nI really had no idea what I wanted to do when I came to JHU. I started out as an electrical engineer, but I wasn't all that into that. Within my first two weeks I switched to physics (technically you're undecided in freshman fall in the school of arts and sciences). I was amazed at how easy it was to switch majors. All I had to do was get a little form and speak to an adviser in the new department. During my sophomore year I got tired of physics and switched once again to mathematics with a second major in computer science, which was once again a very easy process. I wouldn't worry about being undecided, you can decide here if you want.\n\nI think too often people peg us as a STEM school but I think that this is somewhat uninformed. We actually have the best writing seminars program, as well as the best school of education in the world. I have consistently heard from my friends that our history department is filled with fantastic professors. Personally, I really enjoyed the classes I took in the philosophy department. To top all of that off we have one of the best music conservatories in the world just two stops away on the JHMI (the school's shuttle).\n\nI loved my time in Baltimore at JHU. I would have hated going to a place like Carnegie Mellon where you have to apply to a major and can't really switch later on (at least that was the policy when I was applying). The living's cheap, the character of the city is fantastic; it's a great place to put your foot down. I still have so many friends in the area and visit often.\n\nCheers""",MyTribeCalledQuest,4omi4

2shup,Question from a prospective student about undecided majors,3b3pbw,1435358676.0,csjfm8p,"b'I just graduated BME but I had friends from a lot of different majors and I myself am working in a field that\'s pretty unrelated to BME so I think I have a solid set of experiences to justify my views. My earnest opinion, especially if you\'re not sure what you want to do, would be to consider other schools of similar prestige to JHU. JHU is very academic focused in that it\'s great if you want to pursue grad school or be a doctor after college. But in terms of our other programs we don\'t stack up as well to your Harvards, Dukes, Northwesterns, etc. That\'s not to say that you can\'t be successful here, because you certainly can, but the overall major quality/name-brand/job-placement tends to be better at some other schools. As an example, I\'m going into consulting and for this field JHU is not seen as a ""target-school"" in that they lump your application with those from ""lesser"" schools. They give preference to the schools I named above plus others and assume from the get-go that you won\'t be as impressive as someone from ivies or other schools. I know this is true for other industries too, such as banking, marketing, and (although to a lesser extent) engineering. It sounds harsh but the reality of the matter is that JHU, as much as I loved my experience here, leaves something to be desired in terms of industry relations, alumni network, and overall reputation. Again, I\'d just like to reiterate that I\'m not saying you won\'t get a job if you come here, I\'m just saying it\'s going to be much harder for you than for an identical candidate from other schools for various reasons. The school has recently realized this and is trying to make changes to address it such as re-vamping the career center, but it is something you should consider when applying. I know you don\'t really have any idea what you want to do yet and I was just like you 5 years ago but the reality that I wish someone had told me is that the world is a harsh, competitive place and there are some schools that will prepare you for that better than others. \n\nWith all that being said I found that JHU can be whatever you want it to be and it can certainly take you to whatever end-goal you want to get to. Just know in advance that you\'re going to have to work your ass off because it is a very rigorous school (as I\'m sure everyone has already told you) but if you can find your passion and succeed here, there\'s really nothing else in life that you won\'t be able to accomplish because as I\'ve heard from incredibly successful alumni from JHU, Hopkins was ""the hardest thing they ever did;"" harder than starting billion-dollar companies, or heading fortune 50 entities, etc. \n\nTLDR; if you\'re unsure of what you want to do you might want to consider other schools, Hopkins tends to be sink or swim. \n\nP.S. 95% of kids who go to top schools are just like you and have no idea what they really want to do. In your applications to these places you can either spin that to mean you want to find your passion at the school or write about maybe one subject you want to pursue there (you don\'t have to actually pursue it once you attend, it just gives you a basis for writing).

2shup,[Serious] Baltimore Riot Discussion,345siu,1430264353.0,cqrizoe,"b'To start off the discussion: Let me just state how I currently see the situation. \n\nWe had several days of peaceful protests for a good cause. It\'s unclear and I think unlikely that those who were violent in the last few days are the same people who were protesting and who care about the cause. \n\nFrom watching local media (mainly WBALTV11) it appears that police have been behaving pretty well and professional and it is sad to see violence destroying this city. I\'m especially convinced that some of these individuals have complete disregard for the original cause with all the assaults on the BCFD trying to put out fires and save lives. ([LINK](https://vine.co/v/eWUr9wQAEMr)) Not to mention the destruction of the new senior center. I have however seen a couple videos of a police officer throwing rocks at protesters ([LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmWuCx_VII), [LINK]()). I\'ve also seen accounts that non-protestors, including white people, at Camden Yards on Saturday were provoking the violence. ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/cW2UMCo.jpg)) I\'ve also seen plenty of videos of protesters, religious groups, and civilians trying to stop the violence and calm the aggressive groups. ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/So98Avy.jpg), [LINK](https://twitter.com/ACFromDaBranch/status/592839101574946817)) The majority of Baltimore is not being aggressive and violent, and most want peace in their own neighborhoods. ([LINK](http://mic.com/articles/116702/10-images-of-the-baltimore-riots-you-won-t-be-seeing-on-tv))\n\nI\'ve also seen quite a few arguments on social media defending the use for violence and destruction. It sounds like the gist is that peaceful protests aren\'t enough, and the only way to get a voice heard is with violent action in a dire situation. I\'m not sure how to feel about this, but I personally still think the destruction of the city buildings, arson, looting, and damaging and destroying civilian and police cars is causing more harm than good. I\'m open for discussion here. \n\nFinally, I\'m curious how the Hopkins ""Bubble"" community feels. Yik Yak obviously has a lot of trolls being racist due to the anonymity, but it\'s possible that some of those are actual opinions of people. And there\'s immature joking about The Wire references. I don\'t condemn racism of course, but how does the JHU community actually feel about this, especially with many being outsiders of Baltimore? One facebook post of note ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/IT48SO2.png)) brings up the argument that JHU affiliates have no right to advocate peace in this situation. I personally can\'t understand this argument, since it seems hypocritical to argue that the violence IS the right thing to do when you\'re in the same situation. I\'m open to counterargument. \n\nI\'m really curious to have a discussion why some believe the violence is justified. Peaceful protests aren\'t easy but they\'ve been very successful and foster much more respect in the past, and that was the original intention of the protesters. '",Sgt_Ice_Bucket,4tg7p

2shup,Johns Hopkins Univ. Faces $1 Billion Lawsuit Over STD Study. Thoughts?,315qft,1427980620.0,cpym9z9,"b""Email that Ron Daniels sent out earlier today:\n\nDear Member of the Johns Hopkins Community,\n\nMore than 60 years ago, the U.S. government conducted an unconscionable and unethical experiment in Guatemala, in which U.S. government researchers deliberately infected vulnerable citizens of Guatemala with syphilis and other infectious diseases. We feel profound sympathy for the individuals and families impacted by this deplorable study.\n\nWhen the details of this study came to light, a Presidential Commission determined that the Guatemala Study was funded and conducted by the United States Government. In 2010, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services apologized to all affected. In 2012, a federal district court concluded that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.\n\nToday, attorneys representing Guatemalan plaintiffs announced that they are suing The Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System, alleging that Johns Hopkins was responsible for the study. The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members\xe2\x80\x99 participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself, and therefore that Johns Hopkins should be held liable. \n\nNeither assertion is true.\n\nThis was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. Participation in the review of government research was then and is today separate from being a Johns Hopkins employee, and no nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. Government. \n\nAs a leading global research university, Johns Hopkins values rigorous and open scrutiny of history, even when it is complex and uncomfortable.\n\nWe know that historians have previously linked prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members in various ways to other unethical government research studies in Tuskegee and Terre Haute. Although separate from the Guatemala lawsuit, these studies were all deplorable and all demand reflection upon the broader legacy of unethical research. It is important to confront and learn from the past.  At the same time, we cannot let unfounded allegations go unchallenged. We will defend the institution vigorously in court against legal responsibility for the government\xe2\x80\x99s Guatemala study.\n \nIf you would like more information about the university\xe2\x80\x99s position on the lawsuit, we have released a media statement that you can find [here](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/index.html), along with information about the Presidential Commission on the research in Guatemala and its findings.\n\nSincerely,\nRonald J. Daniels             \nPresident, The Johns Hopkins University                              \n               \nPaul B. Rothman, M.D.\nDean of the Medical Faculty\nCEO, Johns Hopkins Medicine\n \nMichael J. Klag, M.D., M.P.H.\nDean, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\n\nSeems like the only connection is some Hopkins faculty members served on the committee that approved funding for this study.

If you want to stay up here, in Charles village, there are usually plenty of furnished places that people would sublet to you. The prices in the summer usually are lower than that of the school year. So don't settle for the first place you find. Obviously row houses would be cheaper but may have rowdier roommates. Since you are working downtown, fells point, the inner harbor, canton, and fed hill will likely have nicer places to live if you can secure a short term lease. I would check craigslist to see if there are any places in those areas you can sublet from a med student. Even mount Vernon could cut your commute and have you live in nicer accommodations for a similar price.\n\nBaltimore in general isn't too dangerous. Just use common sense and try not to walk long distances alone at night. Price range at Jhu can vary from approximately 600-1000$ a month depending on what sort of place you are living in. As I said before, prices drop a little in the summer since there are usually a plethora of places to sublet""",rebel4,a0v70

People generally post their subletting ads in a Hopkins facebook group but you need a .jhu email address to join. I know of a few people subletting and one of them actually lives in a pretty nice/cheap house that's completely safe and central to everything around campus.\n\n2. Tons of people sublet in the summer. Anyone who is not taking classes or doing research at the med campus is probably doing something not in Baltimore so all these people are trying to get rooms off of their hands for the summer.\n\n3. Prices can range depending on where you're staying but I'd say expect to be paying anywhere from $600 - $900 a month total for rent and utilities. Of course it can get lower or higher depending on the luxury/safety you're looking for.\n\n4. People give Baltimore a lot of crap for being unsafe and rightfully so, to a degree. There are many parts of Baltimore that you do not want to be in by yourself, even in the middle of the day. Fortunately, these places are pretty far from campus so you should be fine. Although, there are a lot of robberies/assaults at night if you go lower than 30th street or higher than guilford (so abell, greenmount, etc. as a general rule of thumb you do not want to be past greenmount at night). Anywhere on the north side of campus is really safe, this is where rich people/families live. But, in general, JHU puts security on just about every block within a 3-4 block radius 24/7, so things are pretty safe and there is a night shuttle that will take you point to point at night if you are uncomfortable walking. \n\nPM me if you have any more questions or you'd like me to put you in touch with the person I know that is subletting.\n\nEDIT: So I just read /u/rebel4's post and I totally agree with him that commuting here to downtown could be bad if you do not have your own car. Also, I don't know your age but if you are 21 (or very easily can be), I would recommend living in fed hill/fell's/mt. vernon point because they have a younger crowd compared to some parts of the city and a WAY better nightlife than around Charles Village. The nightlife here in the summer really sucks, it's a lot of house parties which would be tough to find if you're not from here or know somebody. Living in a place like fed hill will put you in the middle of a lot of people in their early-to-mid 20's who like to have a good time and there's plenty of bars/restaurants to do it at. Also, the commute would be a lot better.""",firesIncreaseDPS,7t1cn

He's incredible but demanding.  The tests are hard and are more about taking the logic of what you've learned and applying it to new situations.  It's been a while and they've just it a lot since I took it but it was worth it.  My friends in the regular biochem just seemed to be memorizing things. My experience as a biophysics major was extremely positive and I'd encourage you to take a class in the department.  The class size will be very small, unlike the 250+ you'll have in regular biochem.  The professors will be extremely approachable.  The other students in the major/classes all work together on problem sets in Jenkins 122 (that's the computer lab) and the stuff you learn goes beyond and actually talks about the whys and hows.  It's a great department.  I can't say enough good things about it.  10/10 would recommend.\n\nAs for your other concerns: who's teaching p-chem?  P-chem was not that hard when I took it but I had an older professor who just lectured from the book and wasn't really creative with his tests or problem sets.

It is weird if you end up never knowing any of the brothers no matter how many times you go, though...\n\nb) Not weird at all, just means you\'ll have to make an extra effort to ""get noticed"" so-to-speak.\n\nc) Yeah most kids will get bids to at least 1 house.\n\nd) I\'d say this depends. If you had your heart set on going to this house and went to all their rush events and they told you they weren\'t going to give you a bid (which happens btw), then that would definitely be weird for both parties going back. Otherwise, it\'s probably chill to stop by for a large gathering like a party. Maybe not the smaller stuff, though.\n\ne) Just get to know the brothers beforehand, if you haven\'t already figured out from first semester what houses suit you then you really need to figure this out during intersession. They all have different personalities and take different kinds of people. Visit a bunch of houses both now and during rush if you need to. Also, if you do rush right, you can think of rushing and pledging each as 4 more credit hours on your schedule.\n\nAll that being said have fun, the rush period is a pretty fun time complete with tons of free stuff and cool events.'",firesIncreaseDPS,7t1cn

It's only weird if someone has told you that you definitively won't be getting a bid, since the entire point of rush is to see what fraternity is a good fit for you. \n\n2) Not at all! That's what rush is for. \n\n3) I don't know the stats, but it largely depends on which house you're looking to join. \n\n4) It definitely depends on the fraternity. Some places will have open parties that literally anyone at Hopkins is invited to, and others won't. This also depends on how you didn't receive a bid: If you were told that you weren't a good fit, then you and the fraternity brothers might feel awkward if you show up. If there are enough people at the house that like you, then you could probably still hang out. \n\n5) Meet everyone possible. Be out going, even if it's a bit uncomfortable, because that's how you'll make connections and have the best shot at joining. The rush commitment isn't that big since there are a few events during the week, but pledging is an enormous time commitment. Most fraternities insist that you prioritize school work and your health before any pledging activity, but I'd say pledging becomes the dominant focus of your life. Which isn't a bad thing: you'll form tight bonds with your pledge class and the older brothers you meet. \n\nSource: recent alum/fraternity brother. Feel free to message me if you have questions.

2shup,Just got accepted Early Decision to the JHU Class of 2019!!,2p8lp8,1418575399.0,cmuezmb,"b""Congrats on the acceptance! I got in a year ago and it seems like yesterday. Enjoy your last semester of high school as much as possible because your grades really don't matter (just don't really fuck up). Since you applied early you probably already like Hopkins, but if you're like I was, there are still a lot of unanswered questions and big question marks about the Hopkins experience.\n\nWhen regular decision stuff comes out you'll start to get access to myJHU, your email, and all the fun forms. You'll get to pick your classes over the summer (at 7am EST or 4 am for West Coasters like me), which is super exciting, but also very stressful because you might not get all the classes you want to take. Finally, you will come to Baltimore a little nervous, but very excited to meet everyone and start school. \n\nOrientation is incredibly fun. The required stuff is meh, but it's basically a week of getting to know awesome people and partying most nights if that's what you're into. Try to meet as many people as possible and get a doorstop so people can stick their heads in and say hi (I live in AMR II and it's awesome). One thing I was worried about was safety in the surrounding neighborhood, but I always feel safe while walking around, even when walking to parties at night. Reply if you want more info on the party scene, but I'm not going to go in depth right now because I don't know if you're interested. \n\nCampus is awesome and there are lot's of great things for you to explore once you get here. It might seem impossible to know where to go, but after a bit of time you will have a general idea of where all the buildings are and what is in them. The best advice I can give you is to find your favorite study space on campus because there are lots of good options. I love the reading room in Brody because it's quiet and awesome, but people like studying in the library or in the rest of Brody. The Gilman reading room is also awesome if you want to get a lot of work done. Your dorm will have places to study too, and your room is always a good option if you can actually get work done. \n\nBaltimore has its ups and downs. I came in with really low expectations so I was really surprised by what Baltimore has to offer. Hampden, the neighborhood to the west of campus, is nice and has good food. It's easy to get around with busses or uber, so going downtown is really fun. You should go to Fells Point with your parents because it is an awesome neighborhood on the water and has lots of good food places. The harbor is nice and has great food, the aquarium, and some places for downtown parties. Orioles games are super fun and pretty cheap. That being said, Baltimore is pretty sketchy and you don't have the freedom to just wander like you can in other places. There are very specific boundaries to where you should go in the area around campus. \n\nI took a really easy schedule for the first semester and loved every second of it. The first semester is a time to make and solidify friendships so it's good to not be super stressed about classes at the same time. You could also take advantage of covered grades and take a hard course load to get stuff out of the way while grades don't matter. I loved all my classes, but definitely check the old course evaluations for reviews of the classes you sign up for (google jhu course evaluations). \n\nCongrats again! You'll be on campus before you know it and I hope you love it as much as I love it. """,hongkongdryclean,54pqo

One thing I would add: Don\'t be afraid of Baltimore.\n\nI\'ll say it again.\n\nDon\'t be afraid of Baltimore. Don\'t be afraid of Baltimore. **Don\'t be afraid of Baltimore.**\n\nUnless Hopkins orientation has changed a lot since I was a freshman, a lot of time will be spent on security walks and seminars that will tell you terrible things about the area. Yes, there is crime here, like in any city, but but there are fantastic people and incredible things to see in places you wouldn\'t otherwise go. People have mentioned Fells Point and Hampden, but I\'d also like to recommend you check out the Mount Vernon area, Canton, and Druid Hill Park.\n\nMount Vernon: Location of Peabody, our sister music conservatory. If you like music at all you can take classes there for (I believe) no extra cost. It\'s also a designated art neighborhood. Hopkins has a pretty crazy independent music/theater/art scene, and a lot of it is centered there. Hotspots:\n\n* [Center Stage](http://www.centerstage.org/)- Largest regional Theater in Baltimore\n* [The Copycat](http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/79#.VI5bCCvF_Xs)- Co-op/commune/venue for performing artists of all kinds. Lots of cool shows/bands happen here. [Schedule & info](https://www.facebook.com/pages/THE-COPYCAT-THEATRE/210387653808)\n* [Fifth Dimension](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-5th-Dimension/353046121374434)- The 5th floor of the H&H building. Mostly awesome weird shit happens here. They tend to throw good holiday parties as well, if you every get tired of the Hopkins party scene.\n\nDruid Hill Park- Just a really nice park.\n\nOther fun stuff-\n\n* [The Baltimore Rock Opera Society](http://baltimorerockopera.org/). Take a cool date here.\n* [ShowSpace](http://showspace.tumblr.com/) List of cool shows and events in Baltimore.\n* [Single Carrot](http://singlecarrot.com/) Other regional theater. Not as weird or ""arty"" as some previous suggestions.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn\'t something you need to think too much about at first. I honestly would recommend spending your first semester checking out all the cool stuff campus/your dorm has to offer and not worrying at all about exploring outside the local neighborhood. But save this post for when you start to get bored of campus. There\'s a Hopkins bubble too many people get trapped in, and you miss out on a lot of opportunities.\n\n----\n\nAlso, good freshman hack. If you meet friends that aren\'t signed up for Uber or Lyft, get them to sign up using your invite code. Every time someone you referred pays for their first ride, you $20 off your next ride. (Essentially a free trip.)\n\nAlso, join /r/Baltimore.'",Yawehg,6nksr

Obviously, I highly recommend the climbing trip, since I went on that one :) You get to know some really cool people, make some pretty damn good food together, and have a fun week in the wild!

2shup,Double majoring in Public Health and AMS?,2obaoq,1417820029.0,cmlzure,"b""I would say for starters pick one and then see if you can handle tacking on another.  I double majored in ChemBe and BA/MA in Math.  At first I just focused on ChemBe and took a few upper level math electives.  I declared my math major in my junior year.  It was a bit of work, and I took something like five 400/600 level math classes my senior year.  \n\nIf you are really interested in doing something like biostatistics, or computational biology work I would say choose AMS as your main and then start tacking on electives in Public Health.  In terms of post graduation employment, you will be certainly better off with a degree in AMS than Public Health (no offense to Public Health folks.)  It's just a very applicable degree that is diverse and opens up a lot of job opportunities, and employers will hire simply because you can do math.

As an economics major I have a lot of freedom to take any class that interests me which is awesome. There aren't any classes that Hopkins makes you take, you just have to end up with a certain amount of humanities, science, engineering, and math classes to graduate. I found this particularly awesome because I hate language and I never have to take language, but it's also great because it gives you the freedom to take whatever you want.\n\nOn the social life side of Hopkins, there are tons of awesome things to do around campus and in Baltimore so I never get bored. There are great clubs to join and I guarantee you will find way too many that sound appealing at the clubs fair. One of my favorite things Hopkins does is bring in awesome speakers in something called the [MSE Symposium](http://web.jhu.edu/msesymposium/about/index.html). If you click there you can see who they've brought in over the years. You can find parties at frats and other houses on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays and these are all pretty fun. Fraternities and sororities have rush in the Spring so you don't have to decide until the second semester. If you get sick of the house party scene you can go downtown to some of the clubs and that's also a good time. I went to an Orioles game and my roommate went to a Ravens game so that's also something fun about Baltimore. The Orioles games are cheap for college students on certain nights, but normal tickets are cheap enough too. The aquarium in Baltimore has discount days to make it cheap and it's worth seeing. The food in Baltimore is amazing and there are some really cool, safe neighborhoods (Fells Point, Inner Harbor, Federal Hill, Mt. Vernon, Hampden). It's pretty easy to get around if you're willing to take busses or spend some money on Uber (it's only around $2-3 to go downtown if you split the fare with your friends). The food at Hopkins is really good (ranked second in the nation), but it's nice to go out with friends to change things up a bit. \n\nOverall, Hopkins is a lot of work, but the friends you will meet and the fun you will have makes it worth it. You wouldn't be able to party like crazy every possible party night like you would be able to at other schools, but you'll have fun as long as you take the time to have fun.

At the very least, Dean Boswell should be made to resign. However, it doesn't follow that banning frat parties is a way of dodging that accountability. ~~Every reported sexual assault at Hopkins in the past few years has taken place at frat parties. It isn't as if frats are the only places Hopkins students party. Therefore, one draws the conclusion that there's something particular about frat parties that is conducive to sexual assault, something that seems not to be replicated in other settings.~~ EDIT: I was incorrect about this, see my response to kittycatcate for more info. I believe that most of the rest of my argument stands.\n\nWhile the article isn't exactly clear on what the university *should* do rather than banning frat parties, it seems like there are two solutions. \n\nOne, which I wholeheartedly agree with, is that the university should reform its manner of dealing with victims of sexual assault. The administration's behavior truly has been unacceptable and shameful. \n\nTwo - and here is the real failure of reasoning in the article - is the metaphor of taking the booze away from the alcoholic. It's not frat parties, the author says, but rape culture. Well, okay. There's some truth to that. But as a demand for action by the administration, it's totally incoherent. The implicit demand is that rather than treating the symptom - sexual assault which has been happening ~~exclusively~~ at frat parties - the administration should alter the values and belief systems of all students and non-affiliates involved in sexual violence. First, there's no clear argument put forward as to why they shouldn't treat the symptom *and* attempt to address the root cause. Second, it places an unrealistically large burden on the administration for a problem that demands immediate action. It isn't as if the administration has been capable of eliminating rape culture but is holding off for self-serving reasons.\n\nThis article is self-deluded or dishonest. There may be real arguments to be made for allowing frat parties, but they aren't to be found here. I doubt anyone seriously believes that banning frat parties will solve the problems of sexual violence of Hopkins, but as a triage measure it seems like an appropriate course of action.""",mybaltimoreaccount,7f3xh

2shup,JHU Disorientation Guide....Thoughts?,2i114h,1412303658.0,ckymbdz,"b""Interesting and a good effort at centralizing knowledge.\n\nSome scattered thoughts:\n\nThe real power hierarchy ought to have Bloomberg above the board of trustees. In all seriousness, the weight he swings is unbelievable and the university knows that keeping him happy is literally worth billions of dollars. The thing is, he has clear ideas about how his money should be used that don't necessarily intersect with the interests of the faculty or student body. That's his prerogative and I don't want to sound like he isn't a huge benefactor, but his gifts have strings attached that ought to be examined. The university is clearly frustrated by this at times - witness the awkward dance to get Bloomberg Distinguished Professors at KSAS - but is basically beholden to him for the duration of his life.\n\nThere should really be more on the university's financial situation. From the administration's perspective, KSAS is actually poor. The university endowment is large, but much of it is tied up in the other schools. This led to many of problems that the Dean's Strategic Plan was meant to address. The administration thinks of the Ivies and Stanford as our peer institutions and wants to match them in faculty:student ratio and other measures (that coincidentally are taken into account in the US News and World Report rankings). Most of these schools are able to fund most of their operating expenses out of their endowment, whereas about 80% of KSAS' budget is funded on a year to year basis by tuition revenues. To simplify a bit, the administration thinks it's necessary for the school to live beyond its means in order to bolster its status. The consequences for this are far flung and will be clearer ten years or so in the future after the DSP has been in effect for some time. Anyways, because the vast majority of undergrads are in KSAS, it'd be worth including more specific KSAS funding info, especially since it has been much at issue in the past year.\n\nI'm always interested in building undergrad/grad student solidarity and would be willing to get coffee and discuss the document and the DSP issues if the writers of this document PM me.\n\nI agree that the unsubstantiated comments about the frats are out of place. At many points the tendency to lean toward snark rather than substantial info is disappointing. The last few pages could be rewritten. A list of links to popular blogs?

Slightly more specifically, ""AI"" as a field isn\'t particularly well-defined anymore.  The huge growth in machine learning has mostly supplanted traditional search-based AI (witness the rise of conferences like ICML and the presence of machine learning at AAAI and IJCAI), although there\'s definitely still interesting work going on in multi-agent systems and other areas that I\'m not super familiar with.  I don\'t know much about ""symbolic systems"",  but there\'s been a bit of a backlash against logic-based mechanisms since the rise of machine learning.  On the other hand, there\'s been somewhat of a surge of interest lately in automated and machine-checkable theorem proving (e.g. the new work on homotopy type theory).  Robotics is kind of its own thing.\n\nAt JHU, if you\'re interested in AI then I\'d recommend talking with some of the machine learning people in the CS department.  Raman Arora is our hardcore machine learning expert, but lots of people do a fair amount of machine learning both for its own sake and for specific applications (e.g. Jason Eisner, Ben van Durme, Ben Langmead, Alexis Battle, and Suchi Saria all come to mind).    \n\nI\'m not sure if anyone is actively working on neural nets, but again that\'s in part because neural nets isn\'t a particularly active field.  There are still some people working on it, but it\'s not what it was.  Take a look at the proceedings of NIPS (http://nips.cc/ ), which is probably the most well-known conference for neural nets.  There are very few actual neural nets papers in there anymore. \n\nBut again, this is all just my opinion -- I\'m no AI expert.  As a theoretician, I\'d say learning more math is never a bad idea.

The in between sequence is significantly more difficult than either of the other sequences, especially Chemical Structure and Bonding. I had IB Credit but I didn't want to go to Orgo - in retrospect I really regret that decision. I ended up taking Applied Chemical Equilibrium my first semester, and Chemical Structure and Bonding my second semester. \n\nChemical Structure and Bonding will only have been taught for the second time next year - my year was the first year the class was offered. There's still significant improvements that need to be made to the class. The class is even more difficult than Orgo in my opinion. I'm taking Orgo over the summer  (which is also an option I highly recommend) and it's much easier/more understandable than Chemical Structure and Bonding\n\nOrgo is honestly not as hard as its made out to be. Make no mistake it is a difficult class but it's a class where you just need to keep on top of the material and work on it everyday. So if you can do that a B+ is probably the least you'll score if not higher. \n\nOnly Chem majors can take Orgo lab their first semester so that should open up your schedule a bit.\n\nI would highly recommend taking Expos, Intro to Expos, or IFP b/c you're pre med so your writing intensives should be in the English department.

What does perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, etc. actually mean? WHY is the PPC shaped the way it is? You can memorize the reasons and definitions he gives, but I feel it's hard to do well until you understand the intuition behind them, whatever that means to you.\n\nAlso, I'd suggest studying with someone else (or yourself) and actively explain the intuition behind each thing he talked about in class. It's easy to sit in lecture or learning den and think you understand things, it's a real test to explain to an imaginary class or study mate the meaning behind perfect competition. Also, try to explain it in terms of them knowing no prior information, don't just regurgitate what Hamilton said in class and confirm that you know it, really think about it.\n\nI think intro micro can be a hard class for some people, particularly if econ is not your primary focus, but I think getting a good, intuitive grasp on the main concepts discussed in class (PPC, types of firms, costs, indifference curves, etc.) will help a lot.\n\nBest of luck!""",gogogadgt,dk5tr

2shup,How is Physics and Astronomy at JHU?,22gsob,1396950451.0,cgmssux,"b'Physics major here. Michael Bloomberg recently gave a butt load of money to the school and a lot of it went into the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy, conveniently located next to the Space Telescope Science Institute. Bloomberg is awesome. All of your physics classes and labs will be in there and the labs, classrooms, and lecture halls are all really nice. There is a physics lab for undergraduates to work together on homework and it is awesome. You will find that in college, doing physics homework independently might not work out so well and working in a group in a room surrounded by whiteboards is very conducive to truly understanding the subject. Every professor at JHU conducts research and a lot of them have multiple teams. There are even more people at STSI who are not professors but professional astronomers. All of these people (there are hundreds) are doing very important things in the world of Physics (Think LHC, nobel laureates, Hubble telescope, etc.). If astro is what you\'re into, this is really a great place to be. I am researching stars, more specifically their distribution in the Milky Way and different methods of calculating their distance. I got this position simply by emailing professors, ""Hey I\'m a physics major, I love your work and would like to be a part of it."" Multiple professors responded and I met with many and even had to turn some down. This is what makes JHU really amazing in my opinion.  JHU spends over 2 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR on research. That number is insane, more than MIT, Stanford, Princeton, or any other school. Not to mention half of that goes to the JHU Applied Physic Lab. Oh and also I\'m a freshman. Yes, I am a freshman doing astrophysical research with an awesome professor at a world-renowned university in something that I am passionate about. The best thing is that I am no exception. 70% of students do research at some point and it is readily available. So research at JHU, A+ all the way. Its a very important part of JHU\'s philosophy and an important part of getting everything you can out of the university. Whatever you\'re into I promise you that you will find a professor who is interested in the same thing and there is nothing stopping you from dropping by their office or sending an email inquiring about joining in their study. I urge you to check out the physics and astronomy website and see for yourself. Also check out the movie Particle Fever. I actually ran into Dr. Kaplan (the guy with the ponytail if you watch the trailer or the movie) today on my way to class. But research obviously isn\'t all there is to your education here. Like many top schools, you will find that some professors who are brilliant physicists are absolute shit at teaching physics. If you are a physics major, you will never take a physics class that has more than ~40 people in it. I promise. This means that you can have a lot of individualized attention and the grad students (there are many) can be very helpful. On the other hand a lot of them and the professors as well are just oblivious and only care about their research. Some can\'t even speak english. So some professors suck and others you will love. I\'d give the instruction here a B. Not bad, but certainly could be better. If you have other questions concerning the school (atmosphere, social life, etc.) or anything else about Physics just message me. I know this is long but as a physics student here I feel obligated to tell you everything about it and a lot I have left out. To answer your specific questions. As a freshman, I can\'t really answer physics advising as I don\'t yet have an advisor (you get one at the end of freshman year). All internships take place during the summer so no need to worry about commuting. That question is kind of irrelevant to JHU though. I know nothing about the Carnegie Institution nor other internships in DC. It\'s not like JHU will just give you an internship. You have to apply and enhance your resume and interview and get recommendations (all of which you can do here obviously). So seriously message me if you want to ask more questions because as a freshman physics major I am literally exactly where you could be in a year. '",rip_the_fabric,fxi42
2shup,How is Physics and Astronomy at JHU?,22gsob,1396958986.0,cgmwst9,"b""Just graduated from the department last year.  The department has a lot of great professors, and also the Space Telescope Science Institute across the street, giving you access to a lot of people you can do research with if you're interested in their work.  I knew people who did research with Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in 2011, doing astronomy work, people who did particle research with the data from the LHC, people who had interesting condensed matter labs, and people who dealt with instrumentation and building satellite components.  The research opportunities you want are there.  \n\nAs far as quality of professors and classes goes, I think the department is pretty strong.  Physics majors take their own version of Physics 1 and 2 separate from the rest of the university, which I think is pretty great.  You get a smaller class with more personal attention, and you typically get some great professors teaching.  Also it gives you a great chance to meet most of the people also doing Physics in your year.  Not every professor is amazing, but I doubt that's the case anywhere.  For almost all of my courses, though, I got the feeling that the professor was interested in teaching the material and working with the class, and many were incredibly accessible for office hours.  \n\nSPS, the society of physics students, is constantly putting out bulletins for internship and research opportunities, both near and far.  I don't think I knew anyone who commuted to internships during the year, though.  I saw it mostly over the summer.  That said, that could also just be because of the time consuming nature of commuting if you were to head into the DC area.  I got a research fellowship one summer that wasn't local, so I don't know much about summer internships in the area, but I know a few people who were at APL for the summer.  I believe they got housing closer to DC for the summer, rather than commute, though.  \n\nOne other thing that you didn't ask about, but I think is worth mentioning, is that all of my friends and I that finished with a degree in Physics are either employed or in grad school, or are about to start after purposely taking some time off.  Among the people I know, not one of them had trouble finding placement after finishing their degree.  Pretty happy to see things work out like that.  """,Jernon,48r1w

Interesting, engaging professors (specifically Dr. Leheny who is a super cool dude).  Even way back when I took wave phenomena (probably the hardest class I've taken here and notorious amongst biophysics majors for sucking), Dr. Robbins was super chill, very accessible and a really great professor. Intro level classes are hard to teach well, regardless of department.\n\nI think it's a pretty small major which, speaking as someone in another small major, is usually a pretty good way to go here.  Your professors will know you on a personal level which is awesome.  Also, I am pretty sure physics majors have a pretty sweet study/lab area on the fourth floor of Bloomberg (the physics building), which I only mention because having a communal space for studying really facilitates working together on problem sets/studying together in general which, in my opinion, is the best way to learn.  I'm not sure if physics majors here actually do this but it's a good resource, regardless. All of the physics majors I know have gotten involved in the research they're interested in.  http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/research/ theres the research done here.\n\nAs for your other questions, I can't really comment.

2shup,How is Physics and Astronomy at JHU?,22gsob,1397258726.0,cgpuaxf,"b""Hi,\n\nI recently graduated as a physics major, and was a board member of SPS. Additionally, I had an internship at JHU APL and am now employed full time and working on a masters in applied physics part time through Hopkins. I loved my time at Hopkins as a Physics major. A lot of the people I know who majored in other departments at Hopkins had a very different sense of the school, mostly because of how incredible the physics department is. This is a department that really does care about the well being of it's students. Will they reduce the work because you say it's too hard? Not likely. However, if you tell them that the textbook is awful and does more harm than good, they'll listen. In fact, every year, the end of the spring semester, there's a meeting between the professors and the students where they discuss upcoming changes in the department, and ask for the input of the students. \nI would agree with rip_the_fabric, that Hopkins Physics is great for research. It's obviously going to better in astrophysics, but it's condensed matter and particle physics are also pretty awesome. I had absolutely no trouble getting research as a sophomore. All I really did was walk up to my professor, ask if he had any research opportunities for an undergraduate, and he said yes. So the research is not just amazing, but it's easy to get. \n\nThe classes can also get really small, which is awesome. One of the best experiences I've had in a class was when it was two undergraduates and one graduate. That's it. I learned so much, I was able to ask a ton of questions and it was just an incredible experience. I would disagree with rip_the_fabric about the grade he gave the professors. I can only think of two or three professors who I thought were not up to par. Compare this to the +30 faculty that make up the physics department, and that's a pretty good number if you ask me. I found almost all of them cared about their students learning and understanding the material. Additionally, they gave me great advice, outside of academics. When I was deciding on what to do after graduate, I spoke to a few professors and all of them gave me excellent advice. I had Adam Riess as my advisor and he was really chill, and was very helpful. The same goes for the TAs. However, the academic experience in the physics department is entirely what you make of it. If you want to take just the required courses, you're allowed to. However, you won't have classes like the one I had with three people in it. I found that the more courses I took in the physics department, the more I enjoyed the experience of being there. \n\nThere's one thing I'd like to mention that you didn't ask about that I know Jernon can testify to as well, and that's the social dynamics. SPS, the introduction classes (I recommend you take them and not test out), and PUC (physics undergraduate computing lab) are the structures provided to you by the department that allow you to form strong, and long lasting friendships. SPS is a meeting of people who are interested in physics and physics majors where they have professors talk about their research, watch movies, and have fun. It's an incredible place to meet people in your major and have fun. PUC is absolutely amazing. There is no other major, and I doubt there is a program anywhere in the country that has something like PUC. PUC is an absolutely massive room dedicated to undergraduate physics majors. You basically have key card access to this huge study space any time of day, with white boards (and a few chalk boards) on every wall. There are comfortable couches and chairs in the upstairs area as well. It became not just an academic refuge, but a social meeting point for many of us. \n\nOne thing I would recommend, if you do choose to major in physics, regardless of where you go, is to take a couple of courses in some engineering field. You don't have to major or even minor in it, but if you like programming take one or two courses in computer science. If you like statistical analysis, take some courses in modeling and simulation or statistical analysis. If you like building things, learn a bit about electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. If you choose not to go to grad school this holds especially true. Being a physics major doesn't just mean you know physics, it means you know how to learn and how to think outside the box. However, it's always good to have a bit of technical knowledge. \n\n\n""",forensics409,4fwya

If the honors class still uses Carothers, that's a really good book.  Lots of good details and very thorough.  McTague sat in on some of the grad courses I took last year.  He seems like an okay guy, and english is his first language.  There are way worse options in terms of professors, so I'd say go for it.  \n\nI think in terms of all math classes workload is highly dependent on the professor.  In terms of difficulty, I think everyone has different feels for analysis v. algebra.  Usually you are more capable at one versus the other, but unfortunately you have to take both.  If this is your first 400 level, you'll probably have to get used to writing proofs.  That is a fun transition.\n\nEdit: P.S. I took the non-honors analysis at the undergrad level.  That was a huge waste of time.  Don't bother.  Ended up taking the grad version to make up for all the stuff I didn't learn.  Grad version is also infinitely more difficult.""",kittycatcate,4z9ql

This school will grind you. It will take whatever naive belief you have in your superiority and crush it. It will take your perceptions about the glory of academic research and replace it with the realities of science funding and lab grunt work in modern academia. It will go to great lengths to ensure that you realize that it is virtually impossible to do anything meaningful on your own and that you will need to ask for help to achieve things. \n\nThere's a very real difference between arrogance and self-confidence. The first I think is where you feel like you should know everything. In this case when you realize you don't it's almost paralyzing. The second is where you know exactly where your limits lie and that it's perfectly fine to reach out to others when you encounter something you can't fully comprehend. \n\nWe have our own share of arrogant people, because some individuals will always be that way. But I think Hopkins is among a increasingly smaller number of schools where the environment is engineered to change arrogant people into self-confident ones. It's really hard to think you're the best ever when you're only an average student at Hopkins and getting B-'s in your core classes. \n\nIn the short term, this is somewhat problematic. There will be long bouts of unhappiness and self doubt and a sense of imposter's syndrome. In terms of what is probably better for you in the long haul, it's easy for me to say that what Hopkins puts you through is worth it. \n\nIf this hasn't convinced you and you want actually want an easy go around in college, then I suggest making the opposite choice that I did and take advantage of [the alarming grade inflation at one of our peer institutions.](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/3/grade-inflation-mode-a/) """,jhu,57uyu
2shup,What does JHU have to offer?,1sfeix,1386596485.0,cdx7wg6,"b'I think it\'s silly to base your application decision on sports clubs or ""interesting activities"" on campus. You\'re going to find plenty of things that you like at any school you go to.\n\nHowever, I want to say that if you want to go into research, Hopkins is a fantastic place to do that. The biology classes here are great and really teach you to think like a scientist, and research opportunities are plentiful. There are multiple undergraduate research fellowships you can apply for and in general the atmosphere of the school is one that cultivates undergraduate research. The students here are trusted by the faculty and if you want to do research as a scientist (as opposed to a research assistant) with your own project of which you are the primary intellectual driver, then you will be able to do that here. Although I\'m sure this isn\'t something that\'s unique to Hopkins, I can say that I truly received world-class training from my professors and research mentors.\n\nI loved my time here, and did not share the negative experiences voiced by others in this thread. I can\'t speak for BME, which is undoubtably tougher than a lot of majors here, but a lot of biology majors also complain about grade deflation, which is puzzling because most of the biology classes here are normalized and not truly curved. I remember getting a score in the 80s once in biochemistry that ended up being normalized to something like 130%, which is ridiculous. Or graduate level biology courses where half the class automatically gets an A. These are the extreme examples, but I found that most of my core science classes were fairly generous. Of course, it\'s human nature to seek external sources of non-ideal situations so the things you hear aren\'t surprising. The bottom line is that just because other places have inflation, it doesn\'t mean that we have deflation. I won\'t deny that some classes can be challenging, but it really takes a certain amount of self-centeredness to believe that we are the only difficult school that exists and that the problems people complain of are unique to or ""engineered"" for this school.'",sp808,6c86a

It\'s the name on my diploma. The name ""Johns Hopkins University"" opens more doors than you can imagine. My GPA wasn\'t particularly good but most companies didn\'t even look at that when they saw that I graduated from JHU.

Two of the newer history professors coming in were non-tenure and visiting were by far the BEST academic scholars and mentors I've had. They took time to actually help me with my research projects, met with me one on one throughout the week, and taught wonderful classes. This can hardly be said for the one other tenured prof who didn't give a shit about his class and was so lazy, the lecture slides didn't even have words on them half the time. I don't think decreasing tenure would be a bad thing, it'd make professors actually do what they are supposed to do instead of goofing around.

Anyone who knows me in real life knows that I'm constantly freaking out about something, and that school isn't easy for me by any means. \n\nI don't think the purpose of the blog post was to tell everyone that it was going to be super easy here- I practically failed the test that my friends texted me to wake up for. I was trying to address the idea that students are out to get people, and that students are alone during their four years here, which is absolutely not true.\n\n""",scientistslovecoffee,5l7pq

I also worked for the student PR team for admissions for awhile, and I approached that question completely differently.  Especially in one-on-one admissions interviews, I was blatantly honest.  It\'s tough.  It\'s not a walk in the park on a sunny day.  You\'re not going to be perfect all the time.  You are probably going to end up with test scores or a grade or two (or many) that you wish didn\'t happen.  \n\nThe most important thing is to grow and learn you have to understand and accept what you don\'t understand.  Without a struggle, the long run just isn\'t worth it.  I once had a math TA at Hopkins that told me to study for an exam I should do every single problem in the book until I get one wrong.  Once you get something wrong you\'ve identified the limits in your knowledge.  College is not about boosting your ego, or hanging your grades on your parents\' fridge, or making Dean\'s List every semester.  It\'s about gaining valuable and essential knowledge in your field so that you can solve real world problems after college, and to do that you need to identify and push those limits.  I\'m probably where I am today because during my college experience I had some test scores that yelled, ""Hey, you don\'t know as much as you thought, eh?"" That pushed me to work harder and push myself to TRULY understand the field I was studying.  I am thankful that Hopkins drove me into the ground more than a few times because that\'s all I needed to push myself to do the best I possibly could.  \n\nIf you want a relaxing and carefree college experience, that\'s not Hopkins.  If you want to work hard, and reap those benefits in the future then it\'s a good choice.  You have to be willing to make some sacrifices and endure some pain, but it was worth it.'",kittycatcate,4z9ql

Being with a supportive group with SgtIceBucket and other JHU redditors really helps a lot when it came to studying for exams and tests. I\'m not going to underplay how tough and stressful it can be at JHU. I\'ve known a few people who even got sick because of the competition here (although this is probably very very rare). Her argument is based on a support group, and yes, those help tremendously, esp for studying and keeping yourself on task. Sometimes, it takes a hug from a friend or buying someone a coffee at Cafe Q to brighten up their day and help them get through it. \n\nNevertheless, I don\'t think we should sell JHU the way she puts it. It\'s going to make a lot of people unprepared. I\'ve known people who sabotaged others, yes there are people like that out there. I\'ve almost had my books stolen in the library from going to the bathroom (luckily, the guy next to me asked why someone was taking my books). My RA said that during his year, someone pulled fire alarms during test nights. I think new students should take her blog as ""helpful advice,"" namely form a study group. She\'s not debunking anything. Hopkins has a culture of cutthroat and competition all the way from undergraduate to graduate to the professors. Someone is always there to one-up you and it\'s your decision to react to it or not. I\'m not saying that this competition is good or bad necessarily. The JHU environment has really challenged me as an individual and I\'ve learned a lot. Namely, my work ethic now is top notch, I know when I can slack off and I know when I have to give 110%. It\'s prepared me for my professional life. I\'m currently doing research at another hospital and I\'m writing IRB protocols and grant proposals without any formal training because JHU has prepared me for these tasks. It puts me ahead of others who come from other colleges and my boss is more confident in what he assigns me than what he gives to grad students. '",Gulagman,58qvp

From my perspective at least, the classes are both hard to do well in and not rigorous--your grades will suck if you don't try, which makes sense, but the class quality is so variable it's basically a crapshoot and many classes just don't teach you anything. This is especially true if you aren't planning on immediately going to grad school or don't do research, because then professors give less of a shit about you than they already do. If you come here, you better make sure you're really an academic and enjoy an academic atmosphere, which I am not.\n\nPromoting an image of intellectual rigor is all well and good, but what's needed is an attitude change from everyone from administration to students. Take a breath and relax, because you will fuck up at least one class but your future employers really just don't care. It is possible for this place to be rigorous but not murderous but the people make that not so and reinforce a cutthroat atmosphere that isn't necessarily personally sabotaging others but more of an overall sense that your life will end if you get an A-.

The second half is a group project on an app of your choice or you will probably be given several options. \n\nOn a side note, you are given phones by the department which comes in handy because the android emulator is pretty slow.

2shup,Any Econ/Math majors?,1op7ep,1382134857.0,ccubl5x,"b""Economics / Applied Math major here. The two disciplines are in different schools (Applied Math is in Engineering and Economics is in A&S) so there's not much overlap between the majors. I'll cover both separately. \n\nThe Economics department here is quite good in a lot of ways, and I have enjoyed my time here. You will begin your first year taking either Elements of Micro with Professor Hamilton or both Elements of Macro and Elements of Micro if you did not take AP Macro (I am not sure who teaches the Elements of Macro course as it changes yearly, Maccini taught the course for many years but he recently stepped down from teaching). Professor Hamilton's course is fairly notorious for being difficult, but I found it a good intro to the economics department and economics in general. It should be a course that helps to gauge whether you want to continue with Economics. Additionally, you can also take Intermediate Macro alongside Elements of Micro if you feel you are sufficiently prepared (so you can jump ahead a semester- Elements of Macro is offered in the fall and Elements of Micro is offered in the spring, but Intermediate Micro is in the fall and Intermediate Macro is in the spring). \n\nAfter the elements course you will have your two intermediate courses and will also be able to take about half of the elective courses in the department (you really can't do much until you get Elements of Micro / Macro done except possibly some 200 level courses). The intermediate courses include calculus based problems and are more rigorous classes for Sophomores / Juniors. I would say most economics majors complete both the classes Sophomore year (fall and spring). \n\nOnce the elements and intermediate sequences are done you have Econometrics and about five elective courses left (these elective courses can be taken alongside the core courses so you can be pretty much done with all the elective requirements by junior year if you want to be). Econometrics is basically applying statistical analysis to economics and is important for research and the like. If you squeeze your schedule it's relatively easy to complete all the undergraduate economics requirements by first semester of Junior year. This leaves a lot of time left, and it really depends on what your goals are for what you do after.\n\nA lot of the students in economics are interested in banking / finance / business. JHU (like many other top 20 schools) doesn't have an undergraduate business program and so a lot of students use economics as a sort of surrogate business major. If your goal is specifically finance / banking / something not super quant heavy then I would suggest pairing economics with another social science major like international studies. Economics / international studies is generally easier for students than economics and math or applied math would be (and your cumulative GPA is a fairly important factor in getting jobs, less so for graduate school as performance in specific courses matters), but do what you enjoy.\n\nIf you want to do go further in economics (research or graduate studies for example, as it sounds like you do) then you can also do that. You can begin taking graduate classes as early as you are ready. The earliest you would probably do this is second semester of Junior year, but most probably senior year. All graduate courses are open to undergraduates who are sufficiently prepared, so you can continue on with economics as far as you would like. Taking upper levels undergraduate / graduate courses may be important for graduate school admissions if that is your thing. \n \nAs for research, there's unfortunately not a whole lot you can do your early years. Economics is not like hard sciences where you can work in a lab and easily help out. Most research opportunities are for students who have at least completed econometrics (so at least junior year) and who have some additional math / economics background and know the professor. I wouldn't count on being able to do much research (especially early on) but graduate schools know this and take it into account. You will most likely be doing data collection or something similar for a professor if they needed any help. However, the department is hiring quite a few young professors so this may change a bit as it expands. Additionally, there is the option of doing a senior thesis which will allow you to get some research under your belt before you graduate. There are quite a few outside research options during the summer / breaks also. \n\nAs for the fields you mentioned, you really won't be able to specialize early on as that happens mostly in graduate work. There are elective courses in the department on game theory, and microeconomic theory is covered in elements / intermediate / graduate courses. Really the important thing in economics is taking as many classes as you can (and doing well in them), getting to know the professors, and being on the look out for research opportunities when they present themselves. \n\nAs for Applied Math, I am a lot less active in the department as I enjoy economics more, but doing Math is pretty much necessary for graduate school. (I would personally do Applied Math over pure Math if you had no prior preferences and graduate school was your only goal.) You will be taking all the usual required classes such as Calculus 1,2, and 3, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Probability, Statistics, Optimization, etc. The optimization course in the department is pretty popular (as you mentioned you are interested in that). Also, there are some computational economics / finance classes that can be interesting and helpful. I know the Applied Math department also has opportunities for undergraduate research but again I'm not too involved there. \n\nIn sum, Economics / Math is fairly straightforward, especially if you want to do graduate studies. Both departments are strong and have plenty of opportunities to go as far as you need or desire to. PM me if you have any questions (I also know of a few economics research programs outside of JHU if you are interested in those). \n\nBest of luck!""",gogogadgt,dk5tr

How often in those security bulletins does it say ""Baltimore police arrived and search the scene with negative results""---how much crime might be deterred if there was a full time police presence just for JHU, and then how much quicker could they respond to events if they were stationed locally and only dealt with the JHU areas.

There is a career fair every year, and you can take a look at who\'s attending this year: https://jhu-csm.symplicity.com/events/students.php?_so_list_from29ff2b3472290080aa456617a0dc22a0=0&_so_list_from29ff2b3472290080aa456617a0dc22a0_page=1\n\nCertainly a lot of places a CS major might be interested in working. I have to say I\'m not sure how useful the fair is, I\'ve been able to get solid internships through other methods and I haven\'t invested a lot of time in career fairs or that kind of thing.\n\nAs for individual companies coming to recruit, it doesn\'t seem to be a big thing here. Microsoft came this year, there were probably others but there weren\'t a ton.\n\nOne thing we do get that I think is somewhat unique to the CS department: a LOT of emails about startups looking for CS people. Sometimes some former JHU students started a company, sometimes it\'s a company in the Baltimore area. If it isn\'t a startup it\'s usually a temporary position, like ""we need someone to help build our Android app or upgrade our database this summer"" or something like that. I feel like I get at least one of these emails every week.\n\nSo there certainly is some recruiting, but I haven\'t felt a significant presence from big companies.\n\nOh one more thing, the career center is very helpful, and we do get access to some kind of sort-of-exclusive internship database. Exclusive to Hopkins or some network Hopkins is part of, I think. So depending on where you want to work you might find some good connections through that.'",bobtheterminator,6jypy
2shup,Any computer science and/or applied math majors?,1jrby1,1377164594.0,cbspmqh,"b'For Computer Science, I know people at Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon.  I don\'t know how much say they have in hiring (they\'re new in the last couple years), and those are just some of the big companies.  A few people go to them every year (not so much Apple, but I think that\'s because people don\'t want to as much).  I don\'t think I know anyone that looked for a job and couldn\'t find one somewhere.  Others go to local or smaller companies.  Of course, we\'re close to D.C. and the associated bunch of defense contractors who always say they\'re hiring, but I don\'t know anyone who has tried to go there.  When Microsoft came recruiting this year (with food!), I knew 2/3 of the employees they brought along.  There\'s a bunch of recruiting events in addition to the career fairs each semester.  There\'s been more interest here in the last couple years in startups and such, but we\'re not too good at those yet.  I have come across some JHU people in open source projects.\n\nNatural Language Processing is pretty big here (at least in CS).  The class is indisputably on the list of the couple ""hardest and most rewarding classes.""  Last year, the department hired a new ML professor; I don\'t recall if their looking for another one; there are already some.  This isn\'t my area of interest, so I don\'t know much about the faculty here.  There\'s a few classes, including a new one last year.  A lot of people will double major CS & AMS.  Also not my area of interest.\n\nI think an above-average number of CS students here do grad school, but it is by no means dominant.  I don\'t know what the perception of JHU from industry is, though we get tons of swag at the career fair.'",todayman,4rcjr

Essentially, because of complaints from a fair number of members who, for various reasons, needed gender specific swimming.  In as much of a pc way as possible, we had to extend the gender specificness to both genders for an equal amount of time.  Pretty much, we didn't want specific members to be excluded from being able to use the pool for personal modesty reasons, so the only way to equal it out was to make it the way it now is. Now, I don't know if this is extending into the school year, and if so, to what extent, but for now they made it this way.  I would personally say no, anyone can swim when they want, and if you don't like it then too bad, don't let five of you ruin it for the approximately 1,500 or so members who enter the facility on any given day, but then again I don't make those decisions, and as a private school and health club they are free to make their own rules.\n\nTL;DR People complained needing it, couldn't give it to one gender only, gave it to both.

The following is based on what's available in the fall, and none have pre-requisites.\n\nIntro to Greek Philosophy with Richard Bett is a pretty good course and will give you good background on Plato, Aristotle, and the Pre-Socratics. Workload is manageable (three 6-page papers and a final, no midterm) and he's a good lecturer. \n\nIntro to Bioethics, which I took with another professor, is a pretty fun class. From what I hear Hilary Bok is a good professor (and her dad used to be president of Harvard).\n\nPhilosophy of Religion with Steve Gross is a really interesting class, which I didn't enjoy as much because my TA sucked. The readings are pretty dense but if you have an interest in theology it's a fun class. Just be aware that it is **not** learning about the specifics of various religions; it's about philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God. Workload is very manageable (three medium-length papers and a final).\n\nEthics and History of Human Experimentation with Dan O'Connor is one of the best classes I've taken at Hopkins, and I highly suggest you take it. There are also 10 spots left and I highly doubt they'll be snapped up before you register. It's upper-level, and you have to write two longer papers and there are a ton of readings, but it requres only minimal background in philosophy.

2shup,Student interested in transferring to Hopkins...,1dt427,1368038596.0,c9upxns,"b'Transfer student here.\n\nThe transition for me has been interesting. I transferred from a small liberal arts college very far from JHU in the middle of nowhere. The atmosphere at my old college was completely different. There was a very tight student body, the professors were 100% focused on undergrads and not research, and the administration was very laid back, responsive, and friendly. So, take all this into account when reading my comment. I have also visited nearly every single top tier school in the US and I think I have a pretty good sense of the pros and cons of most major universities in this country. Anyways, coming to Baltimore was quite a transition for me. After experiencing JHU, here\'s what I\'d have to say:\n\nThe Cons:\n\n1. I don\'t think there is much of a student community here or a lot of expressed school pride. Most people seem content in their own worlds, doing their own things with their group of friends, and pursuing their own goals.\n\n2. The surrounding area isn\'t great (and sometimes kind of unsafe) but it is getting better. Plus, I think JHU has a pretty good security force. In terms of things to do, there isn\'t a whole lot outside of a few bars. But, the harbor is relatively nearby and Towson/Loyola are just up the road. \n\n3. The administration and the professors can be somewhat distant. There is more of a focus on research over undergrads. There are always exceptions to this, but in my view there is a huge emphasis on personal responsibility. YOU have to go out and seek opportunities and meet people and make sure you get good grades. No one is going to look after your shoulder or hand you things. Sometimes you might have to be a bit pushy yourself.\n\nThe Pros\n\n1. The students and professors here are all very smart people. I have met some of the smartest people I\'ve ever known in my life. Of course there are slackers and ""how-did-they-even-get-into-this-college"" types of people at every school. But in general, I can be confident that whoever I\'m talking to is a smart person with interesting ideas. The professors are also often world-class and have a wealth of knowledge (although some of them can be kind of socially awkward and/or boring)\n\n2. JHU is very diverse. My old college was extremely homogenous (maybe even a bit prejudiced). Here, I\'ve met students from all over the world with so many different backgrounds. There\'s a good amount of racial integration in social groups as well. Plus, contrary to what people may say, I think people here are pretty friendly and not too cutthroat.\n\n3. JHU has so many opportunities and resources. It\'s location isn\'t bad (it\'s THE university in Baltimore with schools all over the city). It\'s a quick train ride from DC (where there are even more schools). And it provides so many academic programs, research opportunities, networking opportunities, etc etc. \n\nWhen I got accepted into JHU, I was beyond elated. Yes, coming here was a huge transition and there was a tradeoff of pros and cons. But, I don\'t regret my decision. You currently attend a large state college and so you might actually find JHU to be a warm and tight-knit environment - who knows. I was also attracted to JHU for its academics, and I have not been disappointed. \n\nAs for application advice, I\'m not really sure. I was a good student but I wasn\'t anything spectacular (I definitely did not have a 3.9, although I did make Dean\'s List every semester). I was active in a small handful of ECs, but I didn\'t have any leadership positions. I think what really helped were 1. my grades, 2. my essays, and 3. my professors\' recommendations. My transcript showed an upward trend in grades and difficulty in classes, and I got to know my professors very well and they felt comfortable in writing me solid recommendations. The important thing for the essay is to never outright bash your old college. Always focus on the positives and the potential improvements. For example, instead of saying ""X University has had poor academic opportunities"", say ""X University has provided many academic opportunities for me. However I believe that JHU will better provide me with the resources that I need."" Bad writing but you get my point. Don\'t sound like you\'re bitter or that you dislike your college. State that you\'ve appreciated and learned from the experience you had, but you\'re seeking something more. Also, add specifics. Show that you know about the college and what you want to gain from going there. Don\'t make your essay sound generic. A good test is if you take out the word JHU in your essay, can you still tell that it\'s about JHU and not just about any other college? Writing a transfer essay can be 10x harder than writing just a normal application essay in high school. It\'s especially hard since there aren\'t any real guides for transfer apps. You\'re kinda on your own if you want to transfer.\n\nHistorically, the transfer rate to JHU has been atrociously low (less than 5%) and because of that, JHU isn\'t the most transfer friendly school. But, you seem to be in better shape than I was when I applied. Maintaining a good college record is difficult and will put you leagues ahead of the crowd when applying. Sorry for the long post, but I hope it helped. I hope to see you on campus soon!'",townhouse45,blomc
2shup,Student interested in transferring to Hopkins...,1dt427,1367898960.0,c9tlx35,"b'Quoted from an admissions officer [here](http://forums.hopkins-interactive.com/topic/6647152/1/),  \n\n>""The Biomedical Engineering program at Johns Hopkins University is a limited enrollment major. Since the program is designed to be a four year program, it is extremely competitive to transfer directly into the BME program at Hopkins. In the last few years no transfer applicants have been offered admission into the BME major and that trend is expected to continue in the future.""  \n\n>""If space ever opens up in the BME program (and that is an extremely rare occurrence that hasn\'t happened in the past three years) those spots would be filled by currently enrolled freshmen engineering students, not transfer students. Simply put, transfer students applying to Hopkins should not consider BME as an option. ""\n\nThat being said, research labs tend to not really care what major you are, as you generally won\'t know much about their research going into it so they teach you what you need to know over time (for example, I work in a lab that\'s VERY multidisciplinary, and has MechE\'s and BME\'s and CompSci majors). So maybe look for research that interests you, see what department it is in, and if it happens to not be in BME, you\'re in luck!  \n\nAnd just in general, I\'d really recommend you try looking into alternative paths to BME, but if you are DIE-HARD, VERY SET ON IT, then it is somewhat sometimes feasible to hop into BME your sophomore year. It\'s very difficult though. One kid I know who did so is an absolutely exemplary student, and was enrolled in an equally as difficult program prior to switching to BME. He actually wasn\'t allowed to switch, but he just started taking all of the BME-required classes and sort of brute forcing his way into the program, and by junior year when he demonstrated to the department head that not only was he on track for BME requirements, but was also doing very well academically, they finally gave him the go-ahead to officially switch into the department.

2shup,Student interested in transferring to Hopkins...,1dt427,1367900001.0,c9tmb46,"b""Like sushislushie said, it would be very difficult to transfer as a BME. Another thing is looking at other engineering departments' and the concentrations they offer. In MechE, there is a biomechanics concentration, Materials Science has a biomaterials track, and other departments offer similar options. Granted, you have to major in that field to get the concentration, but I'm sure you could take classes from another department to satisfy the engineering elective requirements.\n\nAnd research in BME without being a BME is definitely an option. Labs here really emphasize cross-disciplinary collaboration.""",ameriswissy,6sqcp

Half of the time, no ones there. Do what most normal colleges do, and let the students make their own ice cream. Hopkins is the only college I know which doesn't do this. Also, just look at the serving dishes they use. It looks like they're trying to feed 50 people instead of 500. Its embarrassing when I go there and there's almost nothing available.

Calvert Street, and speak to women in a **peaceful, non-aggressive manner**, hand out literature, provide information about life issues and the abortion clinic itself \xe2\x80\x94 in an effort to persuade the individual (it may be the parent, boyfriend or the woman herself) not to have an abortion, and to choose life for the child in the womb.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem it is their intention to be in people\xe2\x80\x99s faces or wanting to confront people directly.\n\nPerhaps we are on a case of confirmation bias. Poor editorial indeed.\n\nThis comment isn\xe2\x80\x99t to support either sides, just to dissect the problems with this article.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nFrom what I've read and my limited knowledge of this fiasco...there is never any mention of the group's plans to use fetuses or grotesque pictures as a way to protest. Linking this group to a white supremacist group is distasteful...especially coming from the student government. Then again, I have no opinion on this issue...seems a bit overblown. \n\nHowever, I will say this. Someone on the SGA was on the JHMI today and decided to declare things very loudly while being on their phone with their mother. Apparently, VFL is suing the school and a Congressmen from Virginia has already written a letter to the school along with three other lawyers. Hopkins wants to avoid the fiasco, and the SGA president has asked the committee to approve of the group. However, the committee threatened to resign because they thought it would make their own jobs meaningless. The leaked emails meant that VFL has physical proof of bias against their group and in all likelihood, will win in a court of law. Hopkins is just trying to keep things hush so it doesn't get any bad reputation. On the other hand, the area VFL demonstrates in already has a bad view of Hopkins and if they do anything wrong, it would make the situation between the community and Hopkins even worse.

2shup,Social media at Johns Hopkins,1az26p,1364343520.0,c92rg6j,"b'Hey there, everyone. Thanks for the great comments! Let me give you a little more background on where we\'re coming from. I started at Hopkins in December. I quickly noticed that we were good at sharing all the good, serious news about Hopkins on Facebook/Twitter, etc., but we could also do a better job of listening, engaging and having even a little fun. The vast majority of our social communications are indeed ""professional"" -- we share a lot of news from The Hub (hub.jhu.edu). But sometimes, too much ""professional"" crosses over into boring. \n\nWe hate boring. We do not attract the best and the brightest with boring, overly-scripted messages and public relations. We want to be authentic -- and we have a ways to go. We do exciting things at this university. You all are terribly bright. We have a chance to show the world how awesome this place is through social media. We should think big.\n\nOn Facebook alone, we\'ve tripled our engagement year-over-year -- people really do engage with those so-called unprofessional posts. We want Facebook to be a space for two-way conversation. Casual conversation is fine with us.\n\nDo you know what the Hopkins community has rallied around? Simple, community-based messages. The community (you all!) loved that the Ravens won the Super Bowl, and you were in Baltimore to celebrate. You loved that our school was involved in finding a potential cure for HIV. You loved celebrating our 137 years of existence earlier this year.\n\nSo, in short, we want to make Hopkins a smaller place through our social media efforts.\n\nI\'d really like your help in helping make the JHU community the best laboratory and playground for social media that we can make it. I may ask you all for help in the future. :-)\n\n'",gussent,994a5

2shup,Thoughts on the proposed supermarket anchoring whatever they build on the empty lot by Barnes & Noble?,19mzhx,1362568715.0,c8qjw4a,"b""I completely oppose the creation of a supermarket there. It is a waste of space, we have several decent ones a few blocks away, with shuttle service to them. What needs to be done is more in terms of infrastructure, a location where office/small businesses can set up and have a long-term community-friendly atmosphere. Yes, eddies may be a little overpriced, but then again, you are paying for convenience.\n\nI have concerns about how large a store they could build because they will be needing to traffic large volumes of sales, and that is something that will be VERY hard considering the parking situation around here. While, yes, they could do underground parking on one level, and then more parking in the back/above it, with further construction of offices/residences above, they will mainly need to rely on food traffic. That would limit their size to something only slightly larger than Eddies, because in order to pay 'rent' for a brand new building with some decently large footprint... they're going to be losing money. \n\nNow, I am not local to Baltimore, and have no reason to owe loyalty to Eddies; I would and will continue to patronize them (when I need milk/eggs or emergencies), because I would rather give my money to them than to a larger establishment since we already have had Eddies around. I would like to see what the research Armada Hoffler and her group was doing was in deciding what to build there. I would have liked to see some input, or some kind of campaign like [Candy Chang's *I wish this was* project](http://candychang.com/i-wish-this-was/). Admittedly they ae facing the problem of seeing what is good for a community that is centered around the university, but at the same time they are fighting backlash of students who only plan on living in the area for four years, two of those being on-campus housing.\n\nUltimately I think they should of have gone with something that is best for the neighborhood and community in the long run, since that is a valuable piece of land, and they will not get many chances to rebuild around campus. A 'convenient' grocery store for students is bullshit in my opinion, we're young and we can walk at the MOST 15 minutes and be at either the safeway on 24th, giant on 33rd, or 41st, as well as having access to eddies, and *shudder* Charmar/UniMini.\n\nTL;DR; meh.

2shup,Class of 2017! Tips?,14vhee,1355566747.0,c7gt4wu,"b""First off, congratulations! Second half of senior year is so great after knowing you're set after graduation! :] \n\nHere are a number of suggestions just off the top of my head. I might edit this post so that there's more later. I hope they serve you well:\n\n* The library gets crowded quickly and often, so make sure you take advantage of [room reservations](http://rooms.library.jhu.edu/) ahead of time... Like exactly 24 hours ahead of time. You'd be astounded by how competitive it has become to get rooms in BLC.\n* You can get to BWI by taking the JHMI to Penn Station and then the Light Rail southbound. It requires a transfer: you just get off where the train from Penn ends, and get on the one toward BWI and take that to the end. The Light Rail only costs students $1.10, whereas taxis can be $30+. Some say it's dangerous or sketchy, but I've never had a problem riding it.\n* Chinese food is better at the med campus than around Homewood. Hot Mustard and Taste of China are nice places. Don't bother with Orient Express among other poor quality places. For delivery, I'd recommend Paul Chen, and Zhongshan.\n* Chinese food aside, Baltimore has lots of great restaurants. Take advantage of [Restaurant Week](http://www.baltimorerestaurantweek.com/) to try out some great places! Alchemy, Kali's Court, Prime Rib, there are too many to name. You'll have to get off of Charles Village for the really good stuff though.\n* And even on normal weeks, don't just stay on campus. Use the [Collegetown Shuttle](http://www.baltimorecollegetown.org/shuttle/), [JHMI Shuttle](http://www.parking.jhu.edu/shuttles_jhmi_homewood.html), [Charm City Circulator](http://www.charmcitycirculator.com/), and MTA buses (just Google Map transit directions to where you want to be) to get to Towson, and other more adventurous parts of Baltimore. Additionally Hampden is also a nice walk away.\n* Enjoy Greek life as a freshman. It's a great way to meet new friends (while drunk) so you'll have lots of faces around campus you'll recognize (while drunk). You'd be surprised by how many really intelligent people happen to be the really heavy drinkers. Plus this counts as networking, right?\n* There's a food court in Levering basement. Just saying, because apparently some friends of mine didn't know this until their third year.\n* The Digital Media Center has some really fancy electronic equipment you can rent out. Go through their training process and be able to take out cameras, recording devices, etc. on a whim.\n\nMore generic advice that's not JHU-specific:\n\n* Don't buy textbooks until after you start going to class. You'll find that often you won't need them, or you might want to switch out. Actually, don't buy at all when you can borrow from a friend or the library.\n* Declare additional majors and minors early on. You'll get emails from the department regarding events, free food, and internship opportunities.\n* Make friends with people in your major and get a decent study group going. I owe a lot of my grade to being able to work with my team on homeworks and projects.\n* Make friends with some upperclassmen. Previous year's exams and materials are very helpful for studying and doing well on exams.\n* Stay organized, and make to-do lists. It really makes everything less stressful when you break it into more manageable pieces.\n* Keep an eye on what you want to do with your future. While it won't matter too much the first few years, it won't hurt to have that on your mind so that if a great opportunity comes, you'll be ready.\n* Don't rush into too many extracurricular activities or commitments though. Try a lot, but don't commit to too many just so you'll have your options open. And unlike high school, having a bunch of extra clubs may not be as constructive or beneficial so make sure you choose to do only what you truly enjoy doing.\n* Try new things! Be it research, part-time work, volunteering, etc. Keep an open mind and you'll be able to make your time a great experience!\n\nBest of luck!\n\nP.S. /r/jhu is also a great resource, but you already know that so you'll be good. :]""",Dreamamine,70wnr

Some people come to college and see it as a tool to get what they want. In the process, they see others as things in their way. They become to love the thing (becoming a doctor or getting their diploma) and use people. Don't do that. The world will become a much better place when you use things, but love people. \n\nLove means take the time to understand other people and like them for who they are. I don't mean just classmates, but people in the Baltimore community. Baltimore is an amazing community whose people have had to endure a lot. Don't fall into the JHU mainstream of complaining about it constantly. Make a difference. After all, knowledge in itself can be a sin if we don't use it to better ourselves and our fellow human beings. Find a niche and stick to it, whether it is working with kids, at a community health center, or maybe just going to a neighborhood church. \n\nFinally, ask yourself what you need to do in order to be proud of yourself on graduation day. And stick to it. During my time at Hopkins, I've seen genius and talent fall through many times. Some students fall to the pressure or to laziness. They become corrupted with negative and naive ideas. Persistence has led some people I've never imagined being at the top of my class. Remember, to persist. \n\nLive long and prosper. """,,none

Sure, you want to make sure they are dedicated to joining whatever group you're in, but there are better ways of doing that than calling a freshmen up at 2 am to clean your room. I feel like this treatment only breeds resentment, not unity as most proponents would argue.\n\nI'm all for an initiation type thing, where the freshmen for one night have to run around and do all sorts of silly stuff. But it must be stressed that they are not being forced to do anything they are not comfortable with, biggest thing being drinking. If they choose not to drink, that should be respected.\n\nI suppose it's just a mindset toward freshmen that is the biggest indicator. If you think freshmen should be treated like dirt, I'm definitely not going to agree with a lot of hazing/initiation ideas you're gonna have. If you think we need to see if freshmen can take a joke at the expense of a bit of their dignity (e.g. walking through the quad singing Disney songs at the top of their lungs), I'm all for it.\n\nIt's definitely a blurry area and this debate won't go away for a long time.

2shup,Your thoughts on hazing?,10ax00,1348364530.0,c6bvvuh,"b'I\'m in a fraternity, but I was never hazed. The guys before me never really saw the purpose of it. Their mentality was ""Why break you down to build you up? Let\'s just start building.""\n\nHowever, I do know the origins of hazing. Fraternities were never extremely popular before World War I. At the end of the war, many soldiers returned home looking for something similar to their past experience in the army. A large part of basic training was breaking down privates (i.e. drill sergeants) so that they could be rebuilt from the ground up. The training not only tested the will of the soldiers, but also created a camaraderie between platoon members akin to brotherhood. So, when the the soldiers came back, many went to school and joined fraternities. The new influx of former soldiers led to the use of hazing to give the new members the same ""basic training"" as the brothers. This ""training"" evolved into hazing over the past century, changing shape with what is deemed appropriate or legal. \n\nHazing is about creating that sense of brotherhood between new members by having them face challenges together and seeing that teamwork is the only way to overcome. I have heard of programs that do indeed haze pledges, but they do so with the intent of instilling that camaraderie. However, those kinds of programs aren\'t what make the news in the age of sensational reporting. Only the cases where someone dies or brothers go too far are ever mentioned. \n\nFraternities get a lot of shit in mainstream media. Now, the Pike roofie scandals don\'t exactly help the cause, but there are some fraternities on campus that are trying to change the paradigm. Beta, Wawa, SAE, and Phi Delt all do a lot of work for their local charities. Last year, Beta raised the most money out of any team in Relay for Life. Phi Delt raised over $6000 for ALS research. Wawa has their literary society where they go to local schools to help elementary students with reading. Not to mention most groups also do large community service projects around campus. Beta works with the Wyman Park cleanup and Phi Delt works with the Friends of Stony Run.'",robotnik92,71q0q

That said, I think most fraternities here treat there pledges with at least some respect, which is not the case at a lot of schools. I am in a fraternity, we don't really do more than make our pledges clean, run errands for us, and do PT. All of their other tasks as a pledge class are completely harmless team-building activities, which work very well.

2shup,Loving hopkins so far. Have a few questions,zcejo,1346827909.0,c63i0tk,"b""Spring fraternity rush for freshmen is very laid back and much more casual than sorority rush. Most fraternities will post their own calendars of events for the two weeks of rush. Don't try to rush too many fraternities, because you won't make enough of an impression on the guys of any one group. Focus on rushing two or three places. Don't rush a fraternity if you don't enjoy hanging out with the people in it. Fraternities will give you a bid, but you make the final choice on which fraternity to join or to go Greek at all.\n\nHere's a basic rundown of the fraternities\n\n1) Wawa (Alpha Delta Phi) - Currently the football frat, but they're trying to change it up a bit\n\n2) AEPi (Alpha Epsilon Pi) - Jewish fraternity and lacrosse hecklers\n\n3) Beta (Beta Theta Pi) - Nice guys in general, but there's a preppy dress code\n\n4) Lambda (Lambda Phi Epsilon) - Asian fraternity with a surprisingly low GPA\n\n5) PhiDelt (Phi Delta Theta) - Newest fraternity. Basically Beta without the dress code\n\n6) FIJI (Phi Gamma Delta) - Keep to themselves, don't do much on campus besides PhiPsi 500\n\n7) PhiPsi (Phi Kappa Psi) - Water polo and rugby. Not allowed to affiliate with Bloomberg anymore\n\n8) PIKE (Pi Kappa Alpha) - If you can stand PIKE parties for four years, then join\n\n9) SAE (Sigma Alpha Epsilon) - Solid group of guys, with a lot of wrestlers\n\n10) SigEp (Sigma Phi Epsilon) - Former high school athletes that like to watch sports together\n\n11) SigChi (Sigma Chi) - Individually, brothers are nice. As a group, pretty creepy.""",robotnik92,71q0q
2shup,Loving hopkins so far. Have a few questions,zcejo,1346841447.0,c63lfnp,"b'I think getting rid of JHU Confessions was the best thing to happen to Greek Life here. We seem to get along better now that that cesspool of a web site is gone. Fraternities all come with their own reputations, some of them totally unwarranted, some of them probably pretty true. The most important thing is you *must* decide for yourself. Don\'t get pressured into joining a frat that only parties all the time if you\'re not comfortable doing that. Likewise, don\'t get pressured into joining a ""nerdy"" frat if you plan on partying all the time. You don\'t want to be stuck in a situation you don\'t love for the next four years and beyond. Fraternity is an eternal brotherhood that lasts long after you graduate. Make sure you put 100% into your decision.\n\nI\'m in a fraternity and I have friends in pretty much every fraternity on campus. I have nothing against other frats here. Every place is different. You have got to talk to brothers, go to different parties, attend rush events, do your research, etc. If you decide solely based on reputation, whether they happen to be accurate or not, you\'re probably going to regret your decision.\n\nIn general, Pike, SAE, Sig Ep, and Phi Delt throw the most parties, probably in that order. Wawa has stuff ocasionally, they\'re located right next to Pike on North Charles. Sig Ep is way back behind the Baltimore Museum of Art, but they have a cool house. SAE, Phi Delt, and Sig Chi are all around 29th-30th street on St. Paul. Phi Psi doesn\'t throw parties too often, but when they do they\'re a good time. The Lingerave needs to be experienced at least once. FIJI has the ""Islander"" day party during Homecoming every year and that\'s awesome. AEPi frequently throws jams in the Northway apartments where a bunch of brothers live. Beta has a newish house right behind Subway but I think they\'ve been doing more invite-only stuff as of late. Every frat has its pros. I know I\'ve said this like a million times, but you need to decide for yourself. Everything I\'ve said is just *my opinion*. It isn\'t gospel. You have no reason to trust me, I\'m just an anonymous dude on the internet. I am however trying to be unbiased and helpful. So...hope this helps a bit. '",TPaine16,4iugk

This isn\'t summer camp.  \n* Glass pavilion = ""glass pav"", Milton S. Eisenhower Library = ""MSE"", Brody Learning Commons = ""BLC"", University Market = ""UniMini"", Fresh Food Cafe = ""FFC"", Charles Street Market = ""CharMar"".  Never use the long forms.\n* All of the freshman dorms have study rooms - during finals time, when MSE (and now BLC) will probably be full, people often forget about these.\n* Do intersession.  There\'s no reason not to, your meal plan applies during that time, and it\'s literally just three weeks of getting to hang out with friends on campus.\n* Get the unlimited meal plan freshman year.  Especially if you live in AMR I or II or Building A or B.  The extra dining dollars are not worth it.  Unlimited trips to FFC are.\n* Conversely, your sophomore year, get the plan with the smallest amount of dining dollars.  You\'ll probably still have too many left at the end of the year.\n* There\'s a guy who hangs out on St. Paul street named Crazy Mike.  Don\'t give him money, he usually just spends it on cigarettes.  Mostly just don\'t interact with him and you\'ll be fine.\n* Don\'t walk east of North Calvert street alone.  Don\'t walk south of 29th street alone.  There\'s not much reason to walk past there anyway.\n* If you don\'t drink and/or smoke, be aware that a significant portion of your classmates will.  If you\'re going to judge people for it, prepare to find yourself isolated from a large number of your classmates (not saying you have to do it, but judging people for it won\'t make you any friends).\n* If you\'re going to drink but have never drank before, don\'t think you\'ll suddenly become pro at taking shots and chugging.  Even if you have drank before, don\'t think you\'re some kind of alcohol expert.\n* Your RA is not your friend.  They are there to help you, but they are paid to do so.  Some of them are still pretty cool people, but don\'t tell them about how much you drank last night or how much weed you\'re planning on smoking.  If you see them at a party, you don\'t have to hide from them, but don\'t go up and talk to them.  Also, don\'t flirt with them, and definitely don\'t sleep with them.\n* People here will have sex.  Deal with it.  As long as they\'re not disrupting others, it\'s their business.  Girls who have sex with lots of guys aren\'t ""sluts.""  Guys who have sex with lots of girls aren\'t ""players"" or ""man whores"".  They\'re just people who have lots of sex.\n* Getting caught with alcohol by an RA is not the end of the world.  They\'ll take the alcohol from you, write a situation report, and give it to their superior.  At worse you might have to write an essay or do a video series on the dangers of alcohol.  Sometimes, nothing even happens.  Getting caught with weed by an RA is much worse - if they actually see weed, they are required to involve Baltimore PD.\n* This school does not want to see you arrested.  HopCops are not Baltimore PD and are not there to arrest you.  The ""shush lady"" is not there to get you in trouble.  She is there to stop people from getting in situations where BPD would get involved.  You can walk by a HopCop clearly drunk and it won\'t matter as long as you\'re functioning and behaving yourself.  If a HopCop or the shush lady tells you to go home, listen to them.  They are looking out for you.\n* MOST IMPORTANTLY: You\'re probably going from being a big fish in a little pond to being a little fish in a big pond.  Deal with it.  Don\'t act like you\'re still the shit.  No one cares about your SAT scores or your high school GPA.  Everyone here is just as smart as you - most people don\'t get into Hopkins unless they\'re smart (those guys here for lacrosse are still trying to get a good education too).  Everyone here is better than you at something.  In high school, you probably corrected your teachers all the time.  Don\'t do that shit here.  Sometimes they make mistakes in what they write on the board, but for the most part they\'re not wrong.  If you honestly think something is different from what they\'re saying, ask it as a question, don\'t tell them they\'re wrong.  Don\'t ask questions to make yourself seem smart.  Ask questions because you genuinely don\'t understand a point, or because you need clarification.  If it\'s more than a single point that you don\'t understand, don\'t waste everyone else\'s time, go in on your own to office hours or talk to a TA.  If it\'s a question that\'s relevant to no one but you, ask it after class or e-mail your professor.\n\nAlso, if you\'re going to be going out partying a lot, there\'s specific frat-related advice we can give.'",aWickedGangAreWe,6jzfr

2shup,J-Card Mobile has a new look,x52q2,1343325312.0,c5jmibz,"b'Works just fine. \n\nDesign Suggestions (Android Version):\n\n1. The ""Back"" button on the bottom bar is redundant on Android devices since they all already have back buttons. Perhaps remove it and center the ""Logout"" button. For the ""Logout"" button, remove the power icon. It\'s an imagine traditionally associated with powering a device off and on and personally I don\'t find it applicable in software use cases. \n\n2. In the top bar instead of the Home button having a home icon and text, simply replace it with a large home icon and no text. Similar suggestion for the settings button. Instead of having a small settings icon and extraneous space next to it to make the button larger simply replace the entire thing with a larger gear icon. This would have the effect of making the top bar larger but since the J-Cash amount (or within a chosen category, the name of the category being browsed) is a key visual element, having it larger is actually a boon and shouldn\'t be an issue since there\'s sufficient white space below in most cases. \n\nBig change:\n\n3. Holo theme all the icons by flattening the top and bottom bars and their buttons as well as buttons within menu selections.\n\nBigger change:\n\n4. Holo theme the whole thing. I\'m just spitballing here, but instead of having a main menu maybe just be able to swipe left and right between the six categories?\n\nThat\'s all I\'ve got for now. But I\'m also not going to be using it actively for a while so I don\'t really have any usability complaints just yet. Again from a functional perspective it seems just fine and even design wise it looks nicer and is much better than before, but I like pretty things so I thought I suggest some changes. '",jhu,57uyu

2shup,"Anybody use zipcar? Thoughts, experiences?",w4t7n,1341669960.0,c5akee3,"b""I have used Zipcar extensively for about two years.  I have had a mostly positive experience with them, but a few things to keep in mind.\n\n-Your liability is super high if you are under 21.  Damage to the vehicle, anything from a scrape while parking to totaling the vehicle is all on you.  You have the option to purchase damage waivers and a more comprehensive insurance policy once you're 21 - DO THIS!  I've also heard stories about Zipcar being royal assholes in the event that someone is injured/killed in an accident involving one of their vehicles, so be very careful.\n\n-They can be really difficult about returning vehicles late.  You're supposed to call them if that's happening, but that's so they can alert whoever has the car after you and find them a replacement - they'll still charge you the late fee.  Two or three minutes has never caused me problems, but I once rented a vehicle to drive a friend to the bus station early in the morning, with a scheduled return time of 6:00 AM (this is on a weekday).  Whoever was before me left almost no gas in it, and I ended up having to fill it up which brought me back to its spot a whopping seven minutes late - $75 late fee.  Nobody had the car reserved until noon that day.  I contacted them about it and explained the circumstances and they pardoned it.  Which brings me to my next point.\n\n-Their customer service is awesome, but requires diligence on your part.  If the car is dirty, or damaged, be sure to report it to them, otherwise whoever is after you may think you caused it.  Most users are respectful to the cars, with one exception - rule is, you're supposed to return the car with at least a quarter tank of gas.  If you find it near empty, let them know, they may credit you some time so you can use that towards filling up.  They are very generous about giving you credit if something is wrong (vehicle late, the person parked it at the wrong spot, etc), so just be responsible and they'll take good care of you.\n\nBottom line, I recommend Zipcar, but as always, be diligent and aware.""",state_of_alert,1keqg

2shup,Honors Classes?,ur4kj,1339241774.0,c4y6och,"b'Richard Brown from the math department covers their definition of honors classes in two blog posts here: http://jhuchalkboard.blogspot.com/2009/07/beyond-calculus-ii-honors-vector.html and here: http://jhuchalkboard.blogspot.com/2010/05/new-advice-for-incoming-freshmen.html\n\nThey\'re generally using a different definition of honors than the one that would typically be used at the high school level.  Letsdrinktea seems to have a good grasp of the concept.  Typically if you\'re really interested in the honors version, I would recommend taking both simultaneously if you\'re able to that way you get both the ""applied"" version of the class as well as the theoretical version -- particularly as you can never have too much math.  \n\nThe Honors version of math classes can be more helpful for those thinking about graduate school for either math, engineering, or physics disciplines.  Taking one can also be useful for see how math is done at a higher and much more abstract level to see if graduate programs in these areas is really your cup of tea. \n\nAs for a more direct answer, you\'re likely to find fewer students in the ""honors"" version and therefore potentially more attention, but at the same time the professor is going to be expecting more ""mathematical maturity"" from you so you shouldn\'t expect a lot of hand-holding. If you are expecting hand-holding, I highly recommend that you search for and read some of Steven Zucker\'s philosophy about college level mathematics mastery.\n\nIf you call, email, tweet, or comment on Dr. Brown\'s blog or associated facebook page, I\'m sure he (or any of the other math faculty) would be happy to discuss the matter more extensively with you.'",chrisaldrich,3usmh

Some of the other responders here have mentioned cases where it is better to take a course at the honors level, but if you are not a math major chances are you don't actually need the depth of understanding that honors classes will give you. I mean this seriously. This depth will come at a cost of unnecessary additional stress and your sleep at night.\n\nThere is no shame in taking the regular version of the course and working hard and doing well. Also remember that you will also have to balance the honors course(s) with your other classes.\n\nIf you think you can do it, then you should go ahead and try. There are plenty of people that do just fine. Its just that I feel many people tend to underestimate honors classes, thinking it wont be much of a challenge.""",junkybear,5mke0
