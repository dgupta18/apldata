Since you have a wide range of interests, it can't hurt to take one lower level course in each of those Subject areas. I know my friends during their first year took Macroeconomics (Econ) and a decent number took Contemporary International Politics (IS/polysci). I've heard good things about professor Steven David in International Studies as well. For math, the lower level courses are usually taught be circulating professors (i.e. The prof switched each semester). But I recommend taking courses with Dr. Brown when possible since I've heard good things (he's head of Math Dept). 

Do you have a major in mind? And do you have a possible class schedule yet?

Highly recommend the CV area if you're going to be near Homewood.  Hampden is popular, but if you have a car, parking can be a HUGE pain in the ass.  You can walk/bike easily from CV up to Hampden; I do it all of the time. 

If you do decide CV, a row home is optimal.  The closer you get to Greenmount you get though the worst it gets.  Stay roughly around the Calvert/St. Paul area from above 29th street.  Remington is also up and coming and you can bike/walk from there.  There are some very good restaurants and cafes around Remington.  For Remington stay closer to Maryland Ave, East of Howard and above 26th-27th street.  

If you are going to work at JHMI I recommend anything in Canton, but below Patterson Park.  I used to live in Butcher's Hill and had my house broken into and my roommate had his car window smashed.  People will tell you Upper Fells, but it can be a mixed bag--people get robbed and assaulted (during all times of day--even while walking to work in the morning) alllllllllllllll the time around Fayette, Washington, Wolfe, and Caroline (below Orleans/Rt 40).  Anything really below the park is the safest option.  

The other popular option is Mt. Vernon, but I can't recommend it at all.  Parking is infinitely worse than Hampden and, I know this is my own opinion, but a lot of the stuff there (restaurants/bars/etc.) are completely overrated.  Plus rent is higher and it isn't always the safest.  People are constantly assaulted and accosted at gun point around Mt. Vernon.  If you have to get between both campuses the JHMI shuttle for Mt. Vernon can suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.  And that's an understatement.  The problem is Mt. Vernon gets screwed because they're sort of right in the middle, and during rush hour the shuttles are always full and constantly have to skip the Mt. Vernon people.  I can't tell you how much that sucks when it is raining or freezing outside.  </commentText><authorName>_IDriveADodgeStratus</authorName><authorID>reffm</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1495106850.0</commentCreated><commentID>dhpgo06</commentID><commentText>What about Abell Ave in Charles Village?

If you don't have  a car then either think about doing zip cars to go grocery shopping or you'll have to take the Hopkins shuttle to Giant. Not sure what your cup of tea is, but Giant is just your regular 'ol grocer.   If you do end up in Hampden you can also walk to Mom's which has a lot of fancier/organic higher quality food.

I think the hardest classes would be the intro classes (designed to weed out students) because of how nitpicky Hamilton is. After that, you'll cruise until your upperclassmen years. Anything finance related will be tough. Be especially cautious with Duffee, he is a great professor but you'll have to put in a ton of work. 

Not much calculus is used other than the ocasional derivative in the core classes. If you take finance courses though you'll probably end up doing a lot of advanced math. 

Without a doubt take economics of fixed income instruments by Duffee. He only offers it once every two years so it should be available when you are a junior. I will tell you now that if I'm ever hiring and interview a Hopkins student who took that class and passed, they will probably get the job on the spot. </commentText><authorName>tercac</authorName><authorID>8utsv</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>6amdcz<comments><comment><commentCreated>1494574876.0</commentCreated><commentID>dhg09tf</commentID><commentText>depends on where you at transferring from.

- Bomb threats are almost never real. Common sense dictates this as well: If a terrorist wanted to actually cause damage to people/places/things, then why give people a warning of it? Why not just blow them up? Sure, the threat is too great to ignore, and at least one bomb threat has resulted in an attack, but look at this article (https://www.inlander.com/Bloglander/archives/2015/04/10/idle-threats-expert-says-bomb-threats-are-pretty-much-always-duds):

&gt; In talking to a colleague from the ATFE, I asked him how many bomb threats he had responded to over his 30-plus year-career, where he had found a real bomb and he said, &#8220;Zero.&#8221; He has certainly discovered real bombs when called to the homes of bomb makers. He has found real and fake bombs when called by people who saw an odd-looking device on the ground, but again, real bombers bomb, they don&#8217;t make bomb threats.

- The timing. The timing is too perfect -- right before final exams, someone calls in a bomb threat. Really? But again, since it's a threat of a bomb, all JHU could do was take the threat seriously and scramble to resolve the situation as quickly and as safely as possible. </commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>6ai43l<comments><comment><commentCreated>1494547736.0</commentCreated><commentID>dhfbybd</commentID><commentText>Mine was gone as soon as the car was unloaded</commentText><authorName>slthomp2</authorName><authorID>8jyvf</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1494546376.0</commentCreated><commentID>dhfape0</commentID><commentText>There's nothing like that -- they should stay for a day or two to help you get settled.</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>6a5r3y<comments><comment><commentCreated>1494378418.0</commentCreated><commentID>dhc3pvk</commentID><commentText>Studio 7 the Salon and Spa (800 N.

Usually early college relationships/hookups happen at frat parties, when freshmen are out partying a lot. Sophomores &amp; upperclassmen don't usually go out as much. If a sophomore/upperclassman isn't still dating their freshman gf/bf and starts a new relationship, it's usually a friend/classmate/hookup-turned-serious.

There is a reason only 1-2 majors every year skip these classes, and it's because they have background in both math and physics that makes this option better for them.

I was in a very similar situation to you, decided not to skip the courses, and am very glad I did.

However, I don't think a 5 on the AP exam is indicative of having learned the material fully, since I definitely know that people who left half the exam blank my year got a 5. But if you're confident in your physics ability, skipping it might be okay. I do believe you have to talk to the department about it though.</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>68h78h<comments /></submission><submission>67zozi<comments><comment><commentCreated>1493443859.0</commentCreated><commentID>dgvuh66</commentID><commentText>I have not, but:

In some cases, students are permitted to defer their enrollment for up to two years to pursue a travel, work, or family experience that does not include study at another academic institution for credit.
Deferrals are considered on an individual basis and must be requested in writing from the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions. To request a deferral, you must submit your Reply Form, enrollment deposit, and a letter detailing your plans by the enrollment deposit deadline.

If so, they don't offer MSE online, it's MS. I have read varied reviews online I will sum it up here. 

Internet hear-say: 

- Some people say the program is running in easy mode because they know a lot of people who do it are fully employed and don't have much time. 
- Some have said that it's a decent program and you will get a education. 
- Some say since the degree earned is not the same, employers discount the degree. And don't look at it as a worthwhile education. Also, JHU lacks connection with the high-tech world, sadly Google and Microsoft are rarely there apparently (this is what I have read and take with pile of salt) 
- Some have said that the program is way too expensive for what it's worth and instead of spending money, people should try to get their employers to pay for it since JHU is not as highly ranked in CS and engineering. I have heard many people say that Georgia Tech is better and cheaper ($7,000 for the whole degree) but the program is really hard and could take longer to complete.

My opinion:

I am in the same boat, I am looking for their CS program and am conflicted between the dirt cheap price of Georgia Tech VS high price of JHU. Google and other companies continuously hire from Georgia Tech, while JHU is mostly defense contractors looking for programmers and engineers for cheap. And their programs are mostly applied knowledge or vocational vs theoretical and rigorous. Lately I have been debating bridging from their online CS program to a PhD at a top 10 universities in the world. But the program is terminal and people have managed to bridge to a PhD, but it's very rare. I haven't found any alumni page or anything so I can ask them about the question that is bothering you too...so far mixed reviews is what I have had. If you find more info...please share.

I You will never worry about not being able to register for a class, as class sizes are pretty small. You'll probably get to know everyone in your class by the end of your second year. If you want to double in CS that's pretty easy to do, and a lot of ECE students do it. Our signal processing classes/research is world class. The JHU Applied Physics Lab, where many Hopkins ECE students intern and work, is world class. If you want to do research it's super easy to meet with professors (aside from a select few) and get started here, even as a freshman. We have a lounge with free coffee/printing. 

However, I will admit there is little to no help given by the department when it comes to providing internships/job opportunities. This is slightly due to faculty's preference for students to work in their labs over the summer instead, but it's mostly because they don't really care what underclassmen do. There is a career fair every semester (not hosted by ece) but it is geared towards internships in software, defense contractors, or consulting.&#160;

There are also serious flaws with the ECE curriculum here but there are some steps being taken to fix that (kind of). I personally feel like this isn't too big an issue because there is still a great amount of flexibility when it comes to choosing courses.&#160;

Your best bet is to speak to upperclassmen about their experiences in this (and other) departments, but you will honestly be fine with whatever major your choose in the end. </commentText><authorName>EpicCelloMan54</authorName><authorID>bqbhi</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>66x974<comments><comment><commentCreated>1493111381.0</commentCreated><commentID>dgpjpwf</commentID><commentText>Haven't taken language and mind or forensic psych, but I can comment on intro psych and positive psych!

1) Intro psych prof is drigotas- 400 person lecture, no homework/reading, grading is on a point based scale (have to get x number of points out of 400 to get an A), very easy in comparison to other courses at hopkins. Really just have to listen to lecture and memorize notes. He used to base his tests off of backtests, but when i took it he'd changed up the exam so it was different. It's an easy B, but you'll have to work to make sure you know the lectures well enough to score an A (when there's 40 q's on the exam, missing 5 q's is already an 88%) Shouldn't be too hard to get into since it's 400 ppl (depending on what year you are tho it might be)

3) Positive psych - super fun and interesting class! Highly recommend, esp during a hard science heavy semester. Homework is primarily journal entries that take maybe ~1 hr/week and really short readings. 2 multiple choice exams that are memorization of lecture notes. A little bit disorganized but the prof is super nice and you get to do a lot of self reflection which is nice. Might be more difficult to get into, since it's only like a 60 person class. I registered for it as a junior and got in.

But look into the research opportunities at both school too. The opportunity to join a research lab at Hopkins was a huge plus for me. Because it's a smaller school, but there are still so many professors/faculty doing research (particularly with the medical school too), there are a lot of places to look to join labs (whether you do it for credit or for pay, it's still great for your resume when applying to grad school). I ended up joining a lab at the medical school as a research assistant toward the end dof my freshman year and continued working there all the way through senior year. So if you're interested in combining EE and/or CS with medical/life sciences research, there will be plenty of labs to join at Hopkins even as an undergrad. It'll help you see what grad school is like in terms of the research and possibly get your name on some publications too.

That said, Georgia Tech is still a great school, particularly for EE/CS.

If you'r interest is in Neuro, Hopkins is a very good choice. If you're thinking you'd rather go get a job after college (which i usually recommend to engineers rather then go straight into a PhD) Tech will give you a broad set of non-medical opportunities. Hopkins is very high up there in neuroscience though.

This might not be helpful for you then, but I personally think our CS program is really strong and is only continuing to get stronger. The problem is that it's not scaling to the number of students who are joining the major, so it's kind of annoying to get into classes&#8212;something you might want to be aware of.

Additionally, for CS in particular, Google has recently really upped their recruiting here, so I think they're into us :D

If you're considering a double major, I would assume that Hopkins is a better place to go, especially because there are a lot of opportunities to do research here in bio/medicine-related topics with CS.</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1492551976.0</commentCreated><commentID>dgf49eu</commentID><commentText>I was in a similar position as you with the choice to go to a public institution with a top 5 ranked CS program vs Hopkins.

I took a few of these courses (Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, etc.) and really unless you are super into math it's just not a good time. The Applied Math department seems to strike a better balance and people are more fun. Additionally, I think employers prefer the Applied Math / Statistics over Pure Math, but that's just a minor point. Also Applied Math will give you more experience with tools like R / MATLAB which are more useful skills than Real Analysis in general.

The AMRs had consistently strong communities across floors and houses, whereas Wolman and McCoy tended to be a crapshoot. Buildings A/B were basically the deadlands.


That's all anecdotal, but a strong objective argument for AMR is its proximity to the FFC, the freshman quad, and campus in general. There's something cool about actually living on campus, and freshman year is your only chance to do it at JHU.

In the end though, don't stress about it. College isn't like boarding high school, there's a million places to meet people and make friends and the dorm is just one of them. If you end up with a roommate you don't love, you'll still be finding friends during orientation, at activities, in class, and in places you don't expect.

There's no way to optimize your collegiate social life, you've got to just give yourself up to it.</commentText><authorName>Yawehg</authorName><authorID>6nksr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1491913753.0</commentCreated><commentID>dg3utj6</commentID><commentText>I don't think I've heard anyone complain about their experience in Wolman. The layout of the dorm (all the rooms sort of surround a common room) seems more conducive to social interaction, and I've heard that the RAs in Wolman typically do a good job of bringing their floor together. AMR I/II are definitely traditional, and I didn't want to do the communal bathroom thing, but if your reservation is based on the fact that your high school roommates weren't sociable, don't expect the opposite. Roommates are chosen at random unless you specifically pair up with another person, but I would say that bad roommates are on the rarer side. 
All of my friends who lived in Building B LOVED their experience and have stayed friends with their dorm mates up until now (senior year).  
It's pretty hard to get a single room unless you have special accommodations, so if I were you, I'd expect to be put in a double.

That has to include times for tests too, so you're looking at final + study days, and a midterm or 2 + study days, so the actual class time is super condensed. 


When I took it I believe classes were 1.5ish hours. The good thing is they basically have a microphone and lecture on a virtual whiteboard. So you can watch the replays of it later for efficient studying, or if you miss it. 

The hard thing is they still make sure you know all the material that they normally reach over 9 weeks, so you'll have homework every other day probably. You'll also need to watch the class, then spend a couple of hours learning the concepts to ensure you have a good mastery. It's graded as harshly as a standard Hopkins math class, or maybe a bit easier but not much. 

It's a good environment for getting a much better understanding of Lin alg, and the classes are smaller so you can ask questions and contact the professor directly. </commentText><authorName>nah_you_good</authorName><authorID>4pd7d</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1491587470.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfy668y</commentID><commentText>I took Differential Equations online a couple summers back and would highly recommend it. Actually I would recommend taking any course online.

My DiffEQ course was taught by a couple of graduate students, who I felt were very effective at teaching the material and were also good at communicating with students in general. For example they were pretty lenient with credit on homeworks and exams, and were understanding about work turned in late. If grad students are teaching Lin Alg, I say go for it for sure. If not then see who's teaching during the school year and compare. 

The biggest advantage of an online class is the online lectures. You can pause/rewind anytime you want and can watch them at your leisure. If you show up to lecture it's easy to ask questions and have a discussion on the online board. 

The only thing Im unsure about is how condensed the teaching might have to be in order to cover all the material, but during the summer you'll probably have only like two or three classes/job to worry about so it's pretty hard to get behind.

Hope this helps.</commentText><authorName>EpicCelloMan54</authorName><authorID>bqbhi</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>63mzpo<comments><comment><commentCreated>1491444659.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfvft44</commentID><commentText>Just remember to use jh.edu instead of JHU.edu and it usually works for me. </commentText><authorName>Anthrax175</authorName><authorID>emibb</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>63m401<comments><comment><commentCreated>1491453502.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfvoas9</commentID><commentText>60 days is actually a lot of time.  Many cities (DC, NY) are only 30 days (this is favorable to tenants -- they can give as little as 30 days notice to their landlords).  Lots of buildings have pretty near instant availability -- i.e. you can move into an apartment soon after you view it.  

Since you're coming from abroad, I'd recommend finding an airbnb/short-term sublet and look for housing in person when you arrive.  You can also browse Craigslist to find people subletting a room in a row house/apartment or people looking to for someone to sign onto a lease.  If you choose the Craigslist route (I have from abroad - worked out well), definitely ask your prospective roommates to conduct a Skype tour of the apartment.

However, his exam problems are pretty fair and predictable (you also get a cheat sheet); and the curve he has at the end of the class is generous. As far as your class schedule, I would recommend sticking with what you have: Thermo, Intermediate, Biochem, Lin Alg. Transport 1 should be with Frechette in the Fall and KK in the Spring. I've heard that Frechette is a little easier, but KK is a great lecturer/teacher. I would stick with Thermo, since the person who teaches Thermo in the spring is pretty disorganized.

And you definitely want to be taking transport with KK in the spring. Lin alg you don't need for the major - why are you taking it? Intermediate takes a lot of time but as long as you have time its pretty manageable.

All in all, this is a pretty heavy courseload, tbh. If you can do all of this and have time for other stuff, go ahead. But really keep in mind how important balance is - you want to have time to wind down and do extracurriculars and stuff like that.

One thing I really love is the proximity to DC, New York, and Philadelphia. I'm a freshman and this year alone I've gone up to DC probably 5 times and New York twice. It's relatively cheap to do so too (MARC train tickets to DC are $8). 

People here like to complain about being stressed and busy all the time and while it can be true, I feel like it's a bit exaggerated. People like to make memes/rag on the school all the time saying how much they hate it but I love self-deprecating humor so maybe I'm biased (just check out the hopkins meme page). Overall I feel like students do like it here. 

The food at Cornell is probs way better if that matters to you. There's not a lot of options in Baltimore imo, but I came from California with great food so idk. 

There's a ton of clubs and social activism events on campus. One thing I really love is the activist/volunteering done on campus. I tutor a local Baltimore student and am part of a homelessness awareness club. Being in Baltimore really changed my perspective on a lot of issues like this and I don't think a place like Cornell could have done the same. 

Tons of people here do research too, if you're into that. Mostly STEM, but I know some humanities ppl that do it too. I myself have had a lot of cool experiences. I got to go to see a talk by Justice Sotomayer in DC, Bernie Sanders came to our school to speak, I went white water kayaking, I got my own radio show, and I got to go to the Women's March in DC. 

I myself don't really party but it's definitely available if you want it. Mostly frats/sororities. 

Definitely consider visiting both schools. Good luck, and feel free to message if you have any questions!

That being said, I  also have lived my whole life in Ithaca so a big reason for choosing Hopkins is that I wanted to experience somewhere else. And FYI, I was deciding between engineering at the two schools. I don't know what program you're interested but I can probably answer about a non engineering program too. I think that you really have to consider what your interests are and what you value. The biggest difference is going to be the location. If you're really really interested in outdoors adventures like skiing, hiking, mountain climbing, or just experiencing endless tracts of beautiful trails and wilderness, Cornell will offer that 10 fold. But, at the cost of being basically in the middle of nowhere with very limited transportation options if you don't have a car. One thing that I have loved about being here, is that not only does Baltimore offer a wide variety of opportunities, including many outdoors stuff, but I can easily go to D.C., NYC, or basically anywhere else on the east coast. I absolutely love Ithaca, but It can get old and one runs out of novel things to do. There are a lot of other things too. Cornell will have many of the benefits of a large school, and Hopkins will have many of the benefits of being on the smaller end (Cornell's expanding enrollment in fact). If you're interested in medicine or public health, Hopkins' proximity to their grad schools makes for some amazing opportunities. If there's anything specific, please ask. </commentText><authorName>IncompetentPotato</authorName><authorID>h5h83</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>62uh5a<comments><comment><commentCreated>1491111024.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfpff3h</commentID><commentText>Nothing is stopping you from trying both and deciding later.</commentText><authorName>GoSh4rks</authorName><authorID>dm0ss</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1491122394.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfpmwqs</commentID><commentText>As a double major in both, your GPA will be marginally higher if you do Neuro coz the classes are  less curved based. </commentText><authorName>Anthrax175</authorName><authorID>emibb</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1491140113.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfpx0oy</commentID><commentText>Any of those majors are fine pre-med majors.

Take classes for any or all of them your first year and then decide.

The core math/chemistry/physics requirements will be the same for all three, so you have time.

If you're talking about jobs that require much of the specialized technical skills you'd get with an engineering degree, then it's a legitimate concern. But if you could also see yourself in jobs that don't strictly require engineering degrees (e.g., finance, consulting), then BME is perfectly fine; they'd just be looking for analytical and problem solving skills and comfort with quantitative stuff. 

The benefit of BME is that you CAN do premed and still have good degree to fallback on. Because BME overlaps significantly more with premed requirements than other engineering degrees like EE or MechE. But at the same time, engineering degrees in general (including BME), have better job prospects than science majors. For the type of jobs where other engineering majors have an advantage over BME, a BME degree would still have an advantage over science majors like neuro / bio. 

So going back to your concern, it's legitimate for certain career paths. But if you want both premed and engineering, BME is probably the best option. I can't say to what extent being BME makes it to maintain a top GPA for med school; my opinion would be it's much more difficult to maintain a top GPA. But for what it's worth all my BME friends ended up going to very good medical schools or didn't have much trouble finding jobs (to my knowledge). Part of this may be because BME at Hopkins is such a competitive program that it is generally comprised of very driven people with a certain tenacity.</commentText><authorName>hungryhungryhippooo</authorName><authorID>86z7y</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1490243795.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfa059w</commentID><commentText>I'm currently a student here. Your concerns are certainly very real. I have had friends that were BME/premed going in, and all of them have dropped one or the other. I'm not saying both can't be done, because I'm sure it certainly has, but you're right, especially at a school like Hopkins where GPA is hard to maintain regardless of your major, having a competitive premed GPA while also majoring BME is difficult. 

I would add that a lot of students come to this school with premed aspirations, but find out that it just isn't for them. This doesn't mean they weren't able to do it, but rather that they found a different path that interested them more. My greatest advice would be to look into the requirements for graduating BME and for getting into med school, then give it a semester or two. If you are on track for both, then great! But if not, then take the time to reevaluate your priorities.

As for your question about the usefulness of a BME degree, I am not in the engineering school so my knowledge may be limited, however I have had 2 of my BME friends describe the BME learning experience as becoming a jack of all trades and master of none. They said to really get involved in BME you'd need to pursue it at the Masters or Doctoral level. One of those two friends recently dropped BME and switched to EE because he felt like he wasn't learning any focused skills. Once again, this is just word of mouth from my 2 friends, so I doubt it translates to all BMEs at this school. Congrats on getting accepted into the program. Although I'm speaking from inexperience, most of my engineering friends that have graduated told me that your job prospects mainly depend on how well you market your skills, how far you network yourself, and what internships you land. 

I hope these answers help. Also I hope I didn't discourage you.</commentText><authorName>kainharvey</authorName><authorID>16eun0</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1490305177.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfb067l</commentID><commentText>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh the 1000000000000 pound elephant in the room.  I will tell you from experience being in the BME program for a long, long time..........BMEs don't know enough for anything.  They don't know enough engineering and their biology knowledge is often shit.  In fact, BMEs are TERRIBLE at biology.  If you put the word 'nano', 'micro', etc. etc. in front of something it sounds 'cool', but in reality the shit often never works because BMEs have very, very poor knowledge of basic science a lot of times.  

For example, I've seen graduate BMEs get frustrated that EDTA wasn't dissolving in water when trying to make buffers.  Hello, if you had basic knowledge of chemistry you'd realize that it needs a pH adjustment AND understand WHY adjusting pH makes it dissolve.  Names will not be named, but I also asked a BME if they used an assay to detect apoptosis after a treatment.....they recommended me to do a MTT assay.....WTF?  Holy shit, this person is getting a PhD from Johns Hopkins in BME?  There are so many BMEs that claim to know biology but have no clue how to do something so basic like a western blot, immuno precipitation, how to flox a gene, how design a primer for PCR and analyze the results on a DNA gel,  etc. etc....

And I've seen BME undergrads forget what DNA does (but they can do stupid linear transformations using matrix algebra!) and I've seen BME undergrads not even know high school basics of acid base chemistry that is so, so ,soooooooooooo essential for molecular biology.  

Most BMEs though are using it as a springboard to get into medical school or for working in the financial industry, which is fine I suppose.  But if you want to do this as a career, I am extremely doubtful.  You don't know enough engineering and definitely, definitely not enough experimental biology.  Nano- something sounds cool until you ask a real biologist who knows that 'EPR effects' for explaining why a tumor is uptaking nanoparticles is basically BS and that all of this nanoshit has so many off target and genotoxic effects that are often ignored.  


If you want to be a hardcore engineer that does some biology--ChemBE is badass.  If you want to do more biology with some tech thrown in--chemical biology is the way to go, they are much, much better at biology and basic science. </commentText><authorName>_IDriveADodgeStratus</authorName><authorID>reffm</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1490250958.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfa6i03</commentID><commentText>I'm a current BME/premed going to medical school next year. If you really want both, it can be done, however, if I had the choice to go back in time, I would have chosen one or the other. If you are sure you want medical school to be in your future, than it really doesn't matter what major you choose, and there are many easier, interesting majors than BME. Furthermore, GPA is king for med school, and  most schools do not care how hard you had to work for your GPA. The 3.8 cognitive science major will almost always beat a 3.6 engineering major. Regarding job prospects, I can only comment that the other poster is right with the jack of all trades, master of none concept.

If you really, really want med school another major is probably a better option, med (and law as an aside) take GPA **heavily** into account, regardless of major. And sure, you can get a consulting or finance job, but as someone who currently works in consulting I can tell you that your first job out of college will also greatly depend on GPA (though not as much as med school). If you pull off a 3.4 GPA in BME, during interviews at prestigious firms (BCG, McK, Goldman, etc.) you're going to be passed up by the Econ/MechE/Applied Math etc. majors who managed to pull off 3.8+. Your mileage will vary in less prestigious firms. 

Overall, if you can hack it it's very enriching simply for the fact that you get to do design team. If you have other aspirations there are way easier routes to go.</commentText><authorName>firesIncreaseDPS</authorName><authorID>7t1cn</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1490313356.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfb72ii</commentID><commentText>In my year there were BMEs who turned out very well (top jobs at Goldman / McKinsey or MIT phds, etc), but that could be a function of the program being highly selective itself and attracting strong students.

If you 100% want med school, it's way easier to just do neuro or bio and get a 3.9+ and have some good clubs etc.</commentText><authorName>gogogadgt</authorName><authorID>dk5tr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1490269768.0</commentCreated><commentID>dfakwts</commentID><commentText>mofo. you're not even at the school yet. dont worry about not getting a job in four years. speaking as a recent jhu bme graduate ('16)</commentText><authorName>fishmonster69</authorName><authorID>5i47m</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>60k24u<comments><comment><commentCreated>1490121561.0</commentCreated><commentID>df7m8tb</commentID><commentText>So I looked at your link quickly but am kind of unsure what CSA stands for.

I graduated last spring with a MechE degree and aerospace concentration, so hopefully I can help out a bit! 

So specifically for the aerospace concentration, that's done solely out of the MechE department. You have to be a MechE to get an aerospace concentration. The program is basically that 5/6 of your technical/MechE electives have to be aerospace-related, most of which are offered within the department itself. We also have a chapter of AIAA on campus, which was rebooted last spring.

I interned at NASA after my junior year, and that was an incredible experience, and I know other people who did internships at Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, and a few other aero-related companies. It is possible, but don't expect Hopkins to be particularly helpful in this regard (but that's true of an internship in any field). As for jobs, I can't help too much in that regard since I'm working on my Masters elsewhere, specifically in AE. 

Hopkins definitely isn't particularly known for aerospace engineering, though I had a really great experience with the concentration. A few of the courses are taught by lecturers who work at APL and a couple other companies in the area, so it's really great in that regard to be taught by people who work in the field every day. At the end of the day, you're getting a mechanical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins, which is already worth a lot, plus some background in AE. If you want to work in aerospace, having a degree from here is certainly going to open more doors than it closes.</commentText><authorName>ameriswissy</authorName><authorID>6sqcp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1489874616.0</commentCreated><commentID>df3b621</commentID><commentText>We recently had a small recruiting event hosted by SpaceX. </commentText><authorName>DottedGlass</authorName><authorID>zryea</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>601mxk<comments /></submission><submission>5zurft<comments><comment><commentCreated>1489915368.0</commentCreated><commentID>df43q6w</commentID><commentText>Orgo 2 is a prereq for Biochem fyi</commentText><authorName>DaNaj420</authorName><authorID>wvsn5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1489745419.0</commentCreated><commentID>df19ir2</commentID><commentText>So I took Orgo 1 and Genetics my sophomore fall.

Basically the program changed a lot between my year and the year after me.

When I joined you were required to do a thesis, everyone was funded and paid for, and the program took 2 years.  However, the fund that paid the Masters students ran out after my year so there is no more funding available.

The lack of funding for Masters is really standard across the US though.  Its very rare to be funded unless you go for a PhD.  If you want to talk about paying for it you are best asking a student in the year after me since I didn't pay for it myself.  But I think they did it like every other masters student: just get a student loan from a bank somewhere.

As for the classes, in my year we didn't take any classes to bring us up to speed.  My background was in mechanical engineering so I need a lot of help with biology stuff, but there were other masters students with backgrounds in biology who helped me.  And in turn I helped them with things like MATLAB and computer stuff.

So yeah, there is no prerequisite courses required if you are Masters student and you don't have time to take undergrad courses anyway.  Only courses above a certain level count towards the Masters degree requirement and there is a lot of courses to take in a year so you will be booked.

So yeah you will need to find friends to help with courses and you will need to find a loan to pay.  Although potentially there is some scholarships I'm not aware of (talk to someone the year ahead of you).

But in the end this is kind of the situation everywhere.  If you manage to find another Masters program that will pay you while you attend, you may want to seriously consider it, but Hopkins is a great school so I imagine it will still be worth it.

As far as I know, most students don't need to take any extra classes that are typical 'prerequisites' when they start. You're required to take two "Systems Bioengineering" (SBE) Courses (there are three available) regardless of the degree type that you go for. I took all three as an undergrad and I would say there aren't any prerequisites per se, but they all required use of MATLAB at some point, and I believe it's assumed that you have taken the basic math courses (Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, and Multivariable Calculus). I'm not sure if you've taken those, but I wouldn't be *too* worried if you hadn't. You'll have friends and you could catch up on the specific tools on your own time. SBE I and II are more related, and SBE III is its own thing entirely.

The rest of your courses just need to be 400 level or above (i.e. 'graduate' level classes) and you'll likely have quite a lot of flexibility there. Even if you don't have a prerequisite for a certain class, if you're a graduate student especially, most professors will let you in regardless (not that that is a guarantee and I'm sure there are some students who don't have that experience, but I've never had any problems just emailing professors, explaining that I don't have the prereq, and being allowed in anyway). That said, it does depend a bit on the specific class, your background, and how much time you'll have to dedicate to it (if you are missing prereqs). Like if you try to jump into a 600 level CS class without any programming experience (for a computational biology concentration)...that'll likely be a struggle.

Personally, I think the master's is very doable in 3 semesters (I and a couple friends are completing ours in 2 semesters), which means that may be a little less money (not much...but still). I'm not sure about BME MSE, but you can maybe ask about how part-time would work if you want to try to finish in two semesters, but you may have one or two courses left (so you basically pay per credit in the final semester, which could save you quite a bit of money). I know it's possible for ECE because I know someone doing that, but again, you'll want to ask the BME department.

There is a chance, if you get really involved in a lab and a project, that you could get some funding from the lab or a project grant, but that's a very big maybe (I have been paid a bit from a grant, but that's small fry compared to tuition), so I wanted to throw that out there, but I definitely wouldn't count on it. Honestly, I'm not sure what else to say for staying afloat and not drowning in debt for grad school...the majority of people I know either are in debt, have their parents pay for it, or they worked for a couple years and saved up before going to grad school.

Live alone: try one of the apts on west university or an apt in a split up rowhome in CV, Hampden, Remington; you can get an a studio-1 bedroom for $900-1400, but may have to sacrifice some amenities on the lower end.

I would recommend against going with a place like Nine East 33rd or the Varsity, which are really just dorm rooms 2.0. I lived in the Varsity as an undergrad and that was a complete waste of money (tiny rooms, meh amenities, small kitchens, weird furniture, super overpriced, etc), and I've heard/seen that Nine East 33rd isn't that much better (though I admit I am very jealous of the location). 

I lived in the Guilford (note that it is different from Guilford Manor, which is just a block away) for a year and it was pretty nice, though it was a decently long way to walk. Pretty spacious rooms, usually large kitchens, etc. The downsides were that the AC units would only be able to be either hot or cold (the apartment building as a whole would switch at around the season change), and there's generally no laundry unit in the apartment (I might just be spoiled by the fact that I had one in the room for so long).

Hopkins House - I know quite a few people who have lived there, including professors and grad students. Honestly...I would avoid it, based on what I've heard. It's also, imo, quite far from campus in terms of walking (~25+ minutes walking, which would lead to...like more than an hour of walking around every day if you go back and forth more than once).

UniOne - Have a handful of friends who live here, and they generally like it!  I've been to a couple apartments there, and they seem pretty spacious and nice, but the downside is that I think it really depends on who actually owns the apartment. I think it's really walkable too.

Marylander - Another place I've been to tons and had friends who lived there last year. Okay apartment space, but they mostly hated the apartment because of the management and annoying things...like apparently they'll sometimes just tell you they're turning off water access for the majority of the day so you can't shower or use the toilet or anything? Maybe someone else who actually lived there can confirm, but I would personally avoid.

I've never lived in a rowhome, but I have friends who spent a few years there and it's apparently very affordable and spacious, but could be more of a hassle (I think the appeal of a lot of apartments are that they kind of 'take care' of everything for you). In terms of location, I personally love Hampden, but I think it's a bit of a longer walk to campus (not too bad though). There's also the Ambassador Apartments, which I've heard is nice. I actually found my apartment this year through zillow, and it's a super nice place, so that might be worth looking into.</commentText><authorName>SecretAgentMemer</authorName><authorID>12ugs9</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1489468667.0</commentCreated><commentID>devxyhc</commentID><commentText>If you're set on something luxurious, you Nine East is okay in terms of everything looking real nice, it's in a really great location, etc. But it is super small and super expensive. I've also heard a lot of complaints about the security making it really difficult to bring guests (being super rude, etc.) and also having difficulties with management.

I think the best bet for you would be [Remington Row](http://www.theremingtonrow.com/), which is *really* nice and also cheap (~$1200 for a 2BR/month, IIRC)&#8212;but this is because it's in a bad location. It's brand new and looks absolutely amazing, and is right next to R House, which is also a new food-court place that's pricey but good. That's about a 5 minute walk from the southernmost part of campus.

There's also The Academy (previously the Varsity), which is a little cheaper than 9E and in my opinion, a little nicer&#8212;but still quite small. It's definitely really nice though, and there are in-unit washer/dryers and it's furnished, which I appreciate a lot just for the convenience.

You can also take a look at Village Lofts, though if you're looking for a 2BR those go officially for over $3400/month&#8212;but if you find someone and get it through someone else's lease, can be as low as $1500/month, which is a *really* good deal for how nice those apartments are. Finding one of those is really tricky though.

In general, for cheaper things, you can look at the Charles or the Blackstone, which are basically write across the street from campus, the Guilford, the Marylander, the Carlton, the Carlyle, Uni One, or Uni West. I don't know too much about those ones, but I have some friends who have lived there/are planning on living there, so you could look into those as well.

I highly recommend looking into Remington Row for what you're looking for&#8212;it looks really nice, and I would have looked more into it but my parents are not happy with the area it's in.</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1489535323.0</commentCreated><commentID>dex26tk</commentID><commentText>Telephone building might be more to your liking.

As a matter of fact, skip all massive apartment complexes and move into a row home that has a place for rent.  The huge apartment units usually have shite for facilities management, often have pest problems (mice, fleas, roaches, bedbugs) because there are lots of people living&#8203; in one spot, and they tend to be more expensive.   I've used university haven management to rent my place around CV and Remington now for going on 6 years. They own row homes and have units for rent.  Fantastic landlords who have literally responded in less than 1 hour when I needed something fixed.  I rent in CV and walk everywhere, even all the way to Hampden.

As someone who took Physics C mech in HS and Physics 1 here, I'd say that the difficulty is around the same, but exams can get tricky. Averages are always in the high 60's low 70's range, but, again, the grading scale compensates for the difficulty.

It was definitely doable but it was a lot of work at times.  Expository writing is easy and so is Java, especially if you've had prior programming experience.  Discrete math isn't terribly difficult in terms of material but the tests are long and the prof who teaches it barely curves.  Also you have to learn how to write proofs which may be hard depending on who you are.  Haven't taken Computer Ethics yet but one credit classes are usually really easy.  Honors calc 3 was fun but hard, but I heard that regular calc 3 (I'm assuming you're not doing honors) is pretty easy.  So all in all, your only real "hard" class will be discrete, everything else should be easy.  You schedule is definitely doable, and might even be a bit on the easy side, especially if you say you're mathematically inclined.

Honestly, the Internet is good here that I hate being at home because of having to wait and deal with poor internet connection. </commentText><authorName>you_are_who</authorName><authorID>csboj</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1488171557.0</commentCreated><commentID>de8ygza</commentID><commentText>It's pretty good</commentText><authorName>slthomp2</authorName><authorID>8jyvf</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>5w2dv1<comments><comment><commentCreated>1488040219.0</commentCreated><commentID>de6y2gb</commentID><commentText>Since Mac is basically Unix, it's probably the easiest from the get go.

So experience as an undergrad living closer to Homewood may be different.

But anyway, it was nice to have it. My then-girlfriend-now-wife liked to go running in the mornings there since it was more interesting. And we both used to like to hit up some of the happy hours at the otherwise over-priced and over-hyped restaurants.

It is a tourist destination mostly so expect some chains (why people go to chain restaurants when traveling, I will never understand) but also just assume that most places are not geared towards the locals. 

However, around the harbor was nice too! You have PowerPlant live, Harbor East (even more $$$), Fells Points (not too far) and Federal Hill. Those places are fun...assuming you don't need to park.

I will say, one of my favorite days was actually towards the end of my time in Baltimore. We were moving soon and were supposed to be working, or at the very least packing, but we both played hookie. We went to Miss Shirley's which was always packed whenever we could otherwise go, and then we played tourist. We took the water taxi all around, we hit up Max's in Fells Point, we walked the harbor, etc. That was a good day!

That means all students must be out of campus housing. Some international students go back home until the spring semester starts. But if you are doing intersession, it might not be worth going back to India for a week. In which case I recommend living with family/friends for a week. You can also move back in once campus opens after New Years and just stay in the dorms. 

There are no Hopkins specific activities during Christmas as the university is closed. But there are events to do on campus. Res Life also hosts events during the intersession break. 

Hope this helps!

Also, side note: Baltimore winter is not harsh. At worst, it just really windy, which makes it seem really cold. But the last 2 weeks have been around 60 deg F, and warm enough to enjoy without a jacket (or a thin sweater). But you should still have a heavy jacket for winds/snow (which we didn't have this year). </commentText><authorName>you_are_who</authorName><authorID>csboj</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1488080264.0</commentCreated><commentID>de7hy5u</commentID><commentText>Campus housing does totally close so you definitely have to stay somewhere else. Staying for all of intersession as a freshman is a little uncommon as those who take a class during that time typically take B'More (a freshman only class that is only the last week of intersession). If you were going to do B'More or not take anything during intersession, then you can extend break by a couple of weeks, which would probably make going home worth it.

I'm not sure what your price range is, but living in charles village within a few blocks of the university or Hampden is safe. With a car that makes things a little easier and broaden's your options. Baltimore doesn't have as much stuff going on as some bigger cities, but there is some great food, cultural events, and JHU events, not to mention the fact that DC is an $8, 40min train ride away. There are movie theaters in the inner harbor, which is accessible through the Charm City Circulator (free and easy to use). 
I like that there is a lot going on at Hopkins, and that there's that university feel of stuff going on. Baltimore has its ups and its downs, but I feel like people tend to focus on the downs more. Find friends that like to get out there and do things in the city, and your experience will be more enjoyable. As for Chem Engineering I have no idea being an Economics student.

How good or nice it is will just depend on the price range you can work with. But if you want to live a bit further, check out the Mt Vernon area too. You can take the JHMI shuttle to Homewood campus throughout the day. The Mt Vernon and Charles Village areas are safer than where the med school is But in Charles Village you'll just have to deal with having lots of undergrads around too. My Vernon is closer to all the attractions at the inner harbor. If you want something quieter, check out Hampden, it's the neighborhood just northwest of Homewood campus. 

I'm not sure what grad student life is like at Hopkins/ChemBE. But as an undergrad, I thought it was pretty easy making friends just by going to events and joining clubs that were in my areas of interest. Baltimore as a city grows on you. Just be careful when you're walking at night, esp if you're walking alone.</commentText><authorName>hungryhungryhippooo</authorName><authorID>86z7y</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1487895005.0</commentCreated><commentID>de45d8g</commentID><commentText>I was at the medical center for most of my time at Hopkins (Health Economics). I felt unsafe in the area, which really made me regret living so close by. Got mugged, my car was broken into twice, teenagers were hiding on my porch to do drugs, it was a bloody nightmare.

If your program is based in Homewood, I'd suggest living in that area, paying slightly more in rent, and knowing that premium goes a long way in paying for peace of mind.

You'll make friends easily enough. Cohorts for PhDs tend to adopt their incomers fairly quick. If you want a social life outside of chemical engineering, your best bet is Tinder. Second to that, there are several interschool events, like speeddating, sponsored happy hours either on campus or at hosting restaurants, and I got one the other day about ice skating in the park I used to live next to.

I didn't enjoy my time in Baltimore. But, one could argue that grad school's not the place to enjoy yourself. I would choose the program all over again most likely though.</commentText><authorName>BadEThrowaway</authorName><authorID>wbula</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>5vjx6w<comments><comment><commentCreated>1487825458.0</commentCreated><commentID>de2y90w</commentID><commentText>Sorry to disappoint, but the pasta they have available to add your own sauces/toppings to is generally fairly bland and overcooked.

1. It is not that great. You can find things that are good and get by, but you'll definitely get sick of it and nothing I've had is great by any means. Late Night has the best food, but it's still just fine. 
2. The pizza is edible but not very good. Someone said that pizza is pretty hard to mess up -- they're right, but the FFC found a way. I'll still eat it when other stuff isn't looking too good, but it is nothing compared to even like Domino's.
3. Meat is hit and miss, depending on the day and the meat. I think the burgers (there everyday) are just terrible, but any pork/beef/chicken daily options have been fine. I don't eat fish, but I've heard that theirs is not good.
4. Pastas are generally fine but a bit bland. The sauce changes everyday and sometimes is weirdly spicy...other times it's very vegetable-y, which I'm fine with.
Overall I'm really not a fan and can't wait to not need to be so dependent upon it anymore. But the tip about the ice cream is true! It's amazing!</commentText><authorName>strukbylightnin</authorName><authorID>k844d</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1487852186.0</commentCreated><commentID>de3jds9</commentID><commentText>Thanks guys for the quick replies. </commentText><authorName>bluejay_98</authorName><authorID>15kywc</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1487823800.0</commentCreated><commentID>de2wpsd</commentID><commentText>1.

I have some CS friends. They usually take 1 intro CS course like Intro to Java first semester. In the mail, you'll get a booklet that lists typical first year scheduled for each major. But other classes include Calc 3, Macroeconomics, Expos (writing requirement), and Intro to Business. there is probably a list online that explains which AP credits Hopkins takes. They take most of the science ones, but don't take history or English credit. 

2. Yeah you can eat as much as you want at FFC. Yes if you eat too much and don't work out you can get fat. 

3. There's a variety of frats on campus. Social, cultural, service, and professional. They offer various benefits to their members, but I don't know much more than that. The professional ones are probably better at helping you with networking and jobs. 

4. There are no official frat houses on campus. However, fraternities may rent out a house in the surrounding neighborhood for brothers to live in. I think every social fraternity has a house. Some large student clubs also have "houses" as well. 

5. Yes! There is a decent sized Indian population on campus. South Asian Students at Hopkins and Hindu Student Council usually run the Navratri, Diwali, and Holi celebrations as well as various social events throughout the year.  </commentText><authorName>you_are_who</authorName><authorID>csboj</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1487813914.0</commentCreated><commentID>de2nkjo</commentID><commentText>2) That's why they call it the freshmen 15</commentText><authorName>maxximillian</authorName><authorID>51tvh</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1487833870.0</commentCreated><commentID>de35kwx</commentID><commentText>1.

There is a 1 or 2 credit class that just give info about being a cs major and insights by faculty and professionals about post-graduation stuff. Data structures is in java and a common spring class. Other than that, just a lot of other classes one will take to satisfy distribution requirements. So, stuff like intro writing classes, chemistry, physics, lots of math, etc.

4.

4. Also what fraternities maintain frat houses ? I could not find any information about it online. 

5. Are there many Indian kids on campus? Lol. Cuz I'm an Indian and wanted to know if there were Indians on campus or if festivals like Holi and Diwali were celebrated ?

Overall quality of the class: 4.42
Summary:
The best aspects of this course were the knowledgeability of the professor and the interesting subject 
matter. Most students commented that they would have like more instruction on subject material to feel better prepared for exams. Suggestions for improvement included the addition of support materials to encourage comprehension. Prospective students do not need to have prior experience in this course to be successful but a general knowledge of biology will be useful. </commentText><authorName>1stbaser</authorName><authorID>j4ffk</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1487580111.0</commentCreated><commentID>ddyi6mg</commentID><commentText>It's an awesome class</commentText><authorName>bootelo</authorName><authorID>tqfp9</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>5tmb29<comments><comment><commentCreated>1486951816.0</commentCreated><commentID>ddnlucd</commentID><commentText>There's a reason that the class fills up almost immediately.

Many other schools are also now Chemical and Biomolecular Eng instead of Chemical Eng now too. It's just ChemBE because you have the option of doing a concentration that focuses more toward the biomolecular side (i.e., molecular and cellular bioengineering concentration) as Hopkins does a ton of research in medical/biological sciences. You can also do the interfaces and nanotech concentration or no concentration, which is more in line with traditional chemE. If you do a concentration in molec and cellular bioeng, you'll have to take some classes that you wouldnt normally take in other schools for ChemE (e.g., biochem, cell biology). But you'll still have to go through through core Chem E classes too (e.g., thermodynamics, transport I &amp; II, pchem, kinetics).</commentText><authorName>hungryhungryhippooo</authorName><authorID>86z7y</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>5rsgg8<comments><comment><commentCreated>1486178762.0</commentCreated><commentID>ddaj87u</commentID><commentText>I senior optioned Physics I </commentText><authorName>kpbasketball93</authorName><authorID>6tz0t</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1486296763.0</commentCreated><commentID>ddcj6oy</commentID><commentText>Seniors get to pass fail 2 non major req classes</commentText><authorName>Anthrax175</authorName><authorID>emibb</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1486936671.0</commentCreated><commentID>ddncl0f</commentID><commentText>Can someone explain what senior option is? </commentText><authorName>tantheta</authorName><authorID>bqz9i</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>5rjc9l<comments><comment><commentCreated>1486033374.0</commentCreated><commentID>dd7x6zo</commentID><commentText>For diff eq no graphing calculator is necessary.

I lived in AMR II and wouldn't trade it for the world. Sure you have to share a bathroom, but I'm a senior now and live in a rowhouse with people from my AMR house. All of us were random roommates. I did not end up being good friends with the person I lived in a room with, but I did love my hall. We picked up friends along the way but by and large our freshman hallway is the locus of my friend group. Folks who lived in Wolman, McCoy, or Buildings A and B (I think they call them AMR III now) didn't get that and I think they really missed out. My order would be AMR II = AMR I &gt; Wolman &gt; McCoy &gt; Buildings A and B. It is certainly possible to have a sociable floor in Wolman, but I think both the ceiling of sociability is lower and the floor higher than in the AMRs. I lived in McCoy sophomore year and didn't really like it very much. I still had to share a room and the kitchens were tiny and crappy. </commentText><authorName>GrimTuesday</authorName><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1486030312.0</commentCreated><commentID>dd7usmd</commentID><commentText>strukbylightnin answered how the process works so ill just give more insight into each dorm

AMR 1 and 2 are the traditional college dorm experience. Share a room with a roommate, share a bathroom with your floor. My friends that live here only complain about no AC in the first few weeks of school. Good things: you'll get the "social" aspect where people leave their doors open and people hang out in the hallways and you know people on your floor and interact with them. You're also very close to your classes, FFC (the main cafeteria), the rec center, etc. Cons: when I went on a tour here my tour guide's bathroom was on a different floor than his and that totally turned me off lol also I needed to have my own bathroom so if that's you don't go for it. Only good thing about their bathrooms is that they are cleaned for you. 

McCoy and Wolman are pretty much the same except Wolman is a little newer. I live in McCoy. Suite style living with two rooms of two roomates with a shared kitchenette and bathroom. Pros: AC, your own bathroom, have a fridge and extra sink, you can cook basic stuff and have room to buy a microwave if you'd like. Close to Charles Street Market (CharMar) where you can go for groceries or food in the morning. McCoy and Wolman also have amenities like a study room, gym, larger kitchen, and TV rooms/lounges. Wolman even has a movie theater in it although its hard to reserve. Cons: unless you have a floor where everyone particularly gets along you wont really have people hanging out in your common room or socializing like in AMR 1 and 2, people mostly keep to themselves. Personally my roommate and I are great friends so I really got lucky in that not really talking to people on my floor doesnt matter to me. I have a friend in Wolman whose floor always hangs out together and they go to movies with their RA and stuff but again I think it really depends on the people you live near if you're in McCoy or Wolman, whereas its much easier to facilitate being friends with your floormates in AMR1 and 2. The walk to campus in the mornings can also be a pain in the ass but you might as well get used to it as after freshman year you'll always have to cross the street to get to campus. It's only like 2-3 minutes anyways. You also have to clean your own bathroom, but my roomate and suitemates decided how we'd divide tasks up so it actually stays clean and we do our dishes right after using them so its a great situation and i'm quite happy in McCoy. I live on the terrace floor of McCoy (ground floor) which means no stairs, my room is a short walk from the entrance, and my laundry room is right across the hall from my room so I dont have to make a trip to do it and I can just go back to my room and do homework while its running instead of going up and down stairs/elevator to check on it. 

AMR 3 is like a "best of both worlds" type of situation. Right above the FFC, they have air conditioning, and the building is close to the rec center basically so they are in a great spot for getting everywhere, you have the roomate + 2 suitemate setup Wolman and McCoy have, minus the kitchenette. You have to clean your own bathroom in AMR3. However, this dorm doesn't have the amenities that Wolman and Mccoy have, and they only have one common room in their basement with a shitty TV and some couches. My friends there love the proximity of their living situation to everything around campus but sometimes wish they had the TV rooms and amenities of Wolman and McCoy as well as the social aspect of AMR 1 and 2. 

So personally i'd rank them Wolman, McCoy (Wolman is like a more modern version of McCoy) AMR3, AMR 2/1 mostly because I wanted my own bathroom and a suite and was willing to clean my own stuff. 

I would very much encourage you to look for a roommate. I really wouldn't advise going in random, as I have some friends that never really talk to their roommate/dislike them. The GroupMes you form over the summer/right now with other 2021 students are a great place to find someone you might be compatible with, that's how I found my roomate (in a smaller group of like 15 kids, not the huge one with everyone in it). I was looking for someone my age (I was 19 going into freshman year) with similar mindsets on partying, studying, and future plans. People that say "I want to go in blind to be surprised" or something are honestly not making a smart choice, because you don't really "know" this person but you have an idea of their compatibility, so I'd really start thinking what kind of person you want to have similar values with and find that person or at least someone close to that. I'm sure there are facebook groups with male/female roommate searches in addition to the My.jhu portal (at least there were last year) so i'd start thinking about that. I did all of the things I'm advising you to do and my roommate is my best friend here so it works out. 

Another note about MEAL PLANS: As a freshman, you'll primarily be eating at the FFC (the cafeteria) with meal swipes, and you get a set amount of dining dollars to spend over the semester. Meal plans are unlimited meal swipes and like 180 DDollars, 19 meal swipes a week and around 250 DD or 14 swipes a week with alot more Ddollars. If you're living in the AMRs i'd advise getting a plan with more meal swipes because you'll be in the FFC alot, as it's right by you. If you're going to be in McCoy or Wolman i'd advise getting the 19 meal swipe one because going to CharMar for food is alot more appealing on a saturday or sunday morning instead of walking all the way to FFC, and you need dining dollars for that. You can change your meal plan after a few weeks so you have some time to test out whatever you choose though. You'll inevitably end up going to FFC less as the semester progresses though, so dont overestimate how many meal swipes you need. 

Ask me if you have any other questions! I'm happy to help, as many of the questions I had weren't answered that well </commentText><authorName>IMPERIALteig</authorName><authorID>ff4et</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1486034938.0</commentCreated><commentID>dd7yfdi</commentID><commentText>If I were you, I'd try to get a solo dorm in McCoy or Wolman.

2) I honestly wouldn't. The survey will give you some people that you matched well with based on responses who you can then contact to learn more about and decide if you would like to room with them. You could also just leave it up to chance or find someone on Facebook, but I think the survey is more reliable than their liked pages.
3) I live in AMR I and I hate the fact that I don't have AC. They say AMRs I and II are more social, but I think any dorm can be social or antisocial just depending on the people who live around you -- the people on my floor don't talk to each other all that much. I would say Wolman is the best, but it is really about how highly you value distance vs AC vs having to clean your own bathroom.
4) Honestly no idea. I mean someone gets the solo dorm so it clearly isn't impossible!</commentText><authorName>strukbylightnin</authorName><authorID>k844d</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1486173146.0</commentCreated><commentID>ddae4vx</commentID><commentText>objective ranking:

If you're looking for work-study, the best way is to use the student job website. I know it sucks and I hate the UI but almost every position is posted there. One job I know has frequent postings is student monitor. They basically sit at a desk and do homework while occasionally unlocking a room. 

Another way is to just call various departments and ask if they have openings for basic positions. I know there was a fall student job fair and i think there might be one in the spring (I might be wrong).

Also, if you've applied to a number of places and are still having trouble, contact the student employment office as they can help you understand why you may be having difficulty and help you fix it. 

But overall, there are a variety of positions you can work on campus for the university. There's also opportunities at private companies, but I'm not too familiar with that.

I know many Wilsons who applied as incoming freshmen. They typically adapted some research experience they did in high school and expand on it. Or they pick topics of interest they want to do research in and ask a question they want to solve. Either way, it doesn't matter too much as you can just change your project as you need. 

If you're applying as a current freshmen, then the same advice above follows but your project proposal needs to have more detail. 

Ultimately, you will know the level of detail appropriate. They don't expect you to have every single detail down, but if you're at that point, it can't hurt to be specific. But also be sure to properly do all parts of the proposal.

Honestly I never had an issue with the previous management but some did. Only problems I encounter are the water shut offs, sometimes they aren't announced and you will be without water just out of the blue. Or they do it overnight and the shower will take like 10 minutes to heat up. But other than that its a pretty good place with a nice community, and one of the few apparetments that allow pets so if you do move here you will meet lots of dogs. 

As a side note please reconsider if you are terrified of dogs, it's a pain having to wait for the next elevator because someone can't handle being next to my little beagle.

One staple of my stay at the Marylander was shower water changing from scolding hot to ice cold. In one particular instance I was making deep passionate love to my then girlfriend. As things progressed I locked eyes with her as I was coming in from behind under the perfect lukewarm water necessary for the ideal shower back door penetration. Suddenly the shower began pouring boiling water onto our exposed bodies. This not only stopped me from putting it in her booty but also led me to suffer second to third degree burns all around my groin and lower stomach. I immediately jumped out of the shower and sprinted to MedStar Memorial Hospital where the doctor wrapped my penis in bandages and told me I couldn't be sexually active for the next six weeks to let my skin grow back. Sexually deprived after three weeks of no boning my girlfriend broke up with me to pursue someone who had a working lower half. Essentially, the Marylander's terrible water piping led my girlfriend of 4 years to break up with me after the fluctuating water burnt my hot dog worse than the FFC burns their burgers.

Another clear problem with the Marylander is the mold which they attempt to cover up with black paint. All apartments I saw had a layer of black paint where the wall meets the ceiling which upon close inspection proves to be a layer of mold covered in black paint. This is a cheap, low class tactic employed by their management and really reveals the type of people that run the Marylander.

Finally, through the paper thin walls of the Marylander you can hear more disturbing things than in freshmen dorms at Towson. There is constant banging and pounding which either means the Marylander residents are running brothels or they all have basketball courts in their apartments. It would not surprise me if the Marylander mangers themselves were running these brothels, as they seem to have no problem breaking health laws or even any bit of human decency. The brothel would also explain why random men come in and out of the apartment at all hours.

TLDR: Marylander showers caused my dick to burn off and girlfriend of 4 years to break up with me. They cover mold with paint. Management runs a brothel throughout the apartment.</commentText><authorName>amswi2</authorName><authorID>16eqct</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1485401523.0</commentCreated><commentID>dcweasz</commentID><commentText>Probably not the answer you're looking for, but if rent might be an issue, consider applying to be an RA?

I've also heard about the water shutting off randomly, but only experienced it once? Most of the time the shutoffs occurred, it was during the day when I was on-campus. 

If they overhauled management, it's not a bad place to live. Maintenance was usually prompt. I've heard the lower floors have bug problems, but I was on the 8th floor and didn't have too many bugs. The last thing that I will say is that the walls are VERY thin, so if you get stuck with a noisy neighbor, you'll hear everything.</commentText><authorName>palmtreesh526</authorName><authorID>7o37p</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1485406008.0</commentCreated><commentID>dcwiii8</commentID><commentText>I think my friend said that his rent at the Guilford was going to be around $700/month after splitting with flatmates.

You spend half a semester on both, and get a fair depth considering how short a time you spend on them.

Not knowing what your major is, how much time you have, etc. I would recommend taking both the above EE courses rather than the consolidated BME course.  The only reason it exists is to get both requirements in for BMEs who are going to need them later on, but don't have enough time to take both full courses. It does a good enough job so that you can understand later on, but there is no substitute for learning all the material in depth. Get a good foundation if you can.

If you insist on taking Systems and Controls and just want to know what prerequisites to take, again I recommend taking the long route and getting a better foundation. Take DiffEq and LinAlg beforehand, or LinAlg concurrently if you have to. In the same way as above LADE puts two courses into one, and you won't get as firm of a basis. </commentText><authorName>GHOST6</authorName><authorID>9at64</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1485248300.0</commentCreated><commentID>dctkyz3</commentID><commentText>Differential Equations is the only true pre-requisite.

I was lucky enough to start the program when i lived in Northern VA so I took probably half of my classes in person, I went to the main campus a few times to study and participate in some volunteer work. I never felt like a bastard step child. The degree doesn't say "JHU (Online*)" .

/u/nah_you_good's suggestion about comparing focus areas is definitely a good one, and where I'd likely start with my comparison. Also consider your motivations for the degree; the EP program doesn't require a thesis and I found it to be generally less research-heavy than I expected out of a master's program (which I was actually relieved about), but if you're aiming to get into academia it may not be what you're looking for.</commentText><authorName>zweischeisse</authorName><authorID>7mv85</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1484872824.0</commentCreated><commentID>dcmsssu</commentID><commentText>I'm not sure about the online MS in CS at Hopkins, but I do know the online MS in CS at Georgia Tech is a pretty renowned program.

I would suggest Data Structures first because it's easier (subjectively, but I think most would agree), it's in a language you'll already be familiar with (Java, which Intro is taught in), and you'll learn more higher level programming concepts that you can use in other classes, as opposed to Intermediate which is pretty much just about learning to use C (a very difficult language that you will likely not use for many other courses at JHU, if any).  Of course, it's really not that hard to take both at the same time.  If programming comes naturally to you (which I hope it would if you want to major in it), then it's not much more work than taking, say, Intro Physics and Calculus at the same time.

edit: I should clarify that in Intermediate you do learn a lot about good code design, and a lot about how the code works on the backend. You don't learn much about algorithms though, and my subjective opinion is that algorithms and data structures are more important concepts to learn early on.</commentText><authorName>gregofthe</authorName><authorID>78qkb</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1483858139.0</commentCreated><commentID>dc4u49f</commentID><commentText>They're both ass but intermediate for sure</commentText><authorName>StrangeShuckles</authorName><authorID>5jp0x</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>5lt07w<comments><comment><commentCreated>1483502653.0</commentCreated><commentID>dbyg2q6</commentID><commentText>I took bioethics in freshman year.

ChemBE does not require you take that much chemistry.

PreMed classes are pretty predictable; as long as you pay attention in class and put effort outside of class to study, you will get a proportional grade out of those classes. However, cause you spend lots of time focusing on pre-med class studying, you lose a lot of time you could spend studying for chem be classes. Personally, I think you should do neuroscience instead. It gives you a lot more opportunity to do other things around campus like extracurriculars and research. Not to mention, most of the chem be advisors here do not endorse premed and would rather you go into the industry. If you are really serious about premed, I would go with neuro, mcb, or public health (easy af); if you're serious about chem be, stick with it. I've heard the average gpa for chembes is below 3.0.

A detailed syllabus is good of course...but make sure you explain to them the purpose more so than just the work you plan on doing. Needs to be more like a proposal for research vs. syllabus like it's for a class. 

Remember it's really up to the professor if they want to spend any time on it, so you'll need to explain succinctly why it's worth their time.

All that to say: it is possible to make $75k+ straight out of undergrad BME.</commentText><authorName>CrypticParagon</authorName><authorID>8qq4c</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1482644473.0</commentCreated><commentID>dbldkgv</commentID><commentText>Have you looked into financial aid? </commentText><authorName>tomjerry777</authorName><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1482666342.0</commentCreated><commentID>dblpzkd</commentID><commentText>I went to NC state for undergrad and am at JHU BME grad school.

Yes, the cost is high, both in financial and time. If this is what you want to do, there are few other places that will give the wow factor as much as JHU for BME. Do you want BME to lead into med school? If so, probably not the best idea unless you want to spend a lot of time studying to keep your GPA up. Personally, I think it's worth it. I learn a lot of cool shit, how to apply it, and Design Team is a blast. I know many seniors who have landed 70k+ jobs after they graduate, even one or two who snagged 100k.

I came in as a Chemistry major, changed to Sociology and International Studies (with a really great new track we started my freshman year), while still having time/room to fit in 2 minors without needing to overload on credits. Of course there were a lot of courses that were cross-listed as IS and Sociology, but still being able to fit so much in 4 years without the classwork getting overwhelming was nice. 

I also really like Baltimore City. If you're from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadephia, etc. it might not be that special, but I came from a pretty boring suburban city nothing like Baltimore. Being able to live in a city was really cool for me, and learning how to navigate through public transportation throughout the city was a valuable skill I have now. Not to mention the city is really cool! Every neighborhood is so distinct, the people in this city are overwhelmingly friendly and the city has a really fascinating history (War of 1812, Civil War, Civil Rights Movement and one of the country's biggest riots, etc.). Living and working in a city like this now with such a history and culture of resilience and pride is really cool. I think Hopkins students tend to complain way too much about this city, but you have to get out and explore, because there is SO much to do.</commentText><authorName>Kwells1994</authorName><authorID>fdzy5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1482383721.0</commentCreated><commentID>dbh9y1u</commentID><commentText>Chicken parm.

The research opportunities are also great. It's a very research-oriented university and has one of the best medical schools available to you too. There are so many research labs at the med school, and on Homewood campus too, that it's easy to find a spot in a lab doing research that interests you and get that exposure. It helps on applications should you decide to go to grad school/med school too. Of course this depends on what your major is. But I'm not as familiar with research opportunities at Hopkins outside the STEM fields.</commentText><authorName>hungryhungryhippooo</authorName><authorID>86z7y</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1482383429.0</commentCreated><commentID>dbh9pii</commentID><commentText>Flexibility in your curriculum and the amount of research opportunities.

I came in a neuroscience and then changed to Computer Science even before my freshman year began. But I still had a interest in neuroscience which was no problem because I used all my humanities requirements to take neuroscience courses like Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience. Furthermore in my major they're pretty lax about the order of classes to take so I was able to take interesting, harder classes very early on and learn more about what I'm interested in. Also I've tried to do research at two labs and while none have worked out so far (I realized I'm not interested in their work) I was surprised at how open the professors were in letting me come in and try their labs out even though I told them I'm still trying to find out what I'm passionate about.

TL;DR Hopkins lets you explore your interests and gives many opportunities to go as far as you want in any field through research or the courses they offer.</commentText><authorName>curious_neuron</authorName><authorID>wqqfh</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1482410369.0</commentCreated><commentID>dbhsgy2</commentID><commentText>Agree with everyone else on this thread-- definitely the flexibility. I'm currently an undecided freshman, so the fact that there are no required classes but rather distribution requirements has been extremely helpful in terms of exploring concentrations and taking classes that interest me in general. 

Some other wonderful things about Hopkins:
1) The community. Hopkins really gets a bad rep for being competitive and cutthroat, but in my experiences so far I have found classmates are often willing to help. Or unite with you in struggling/studying through the class more than anything.

2) The versatility-- both in the school and the city. Hopkins is mostly known for being that "doctor school" but the humanities department is also really strong here. On the other hand, Baltimore has so many attractions to explore: Miracle on 34th Street, Inner Harbor, National Aquarium are just some examples. And the BMA is right next to Hopkins too!

3) If you're into social justice and activism, or are even just interested in it, Baltimore is a great place to make an impact. For example, I'm currently involved in organizations that give financial advice to low-income citizens, and mentor previously incarcerated Baltimoreans.

Let me know if you have any questions!!

If you believe you can still get a good GPA in BME, it does look better to adcoms than the same GPA in a less rigorous major. How certain are you that you want to go to med school? Many students start out as premed but decide not to go to med school in the end.

 If you absolutely know all you want to get out of college is pre-med, then it's normal to major in something like public health, so that you have the freedom to take the pre-med reqs and focus on those as your hardest classes each semester.

However if you're not committed 100% and you have any interest in Engineering (or even a more mathematical/coding side to medicine) then BME offers a great major that explore those interests, and also fits the pre-Med reqs fairly easily.

As others have said BME opens more doors, and leaves the possibility for pre-med open.</commentText><authorName>GHOST6</authorName><authorID>9at64</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1482038474.0</commentCreated><commentID>dbbi1gj</commentID><commentText>Hopkins is a fantastic school for BME and the program is hands down one of the best.

I was not pre-med but I know several fellow BMEs who were. Med schools might consider the rigor of the program but frankly they don't have time to figure out which programs at which university are grade deflated. Your med school app will probably be thrown in the engineering pile and they might give you a slight boost. Don't bank on the BME prestige to get over a mediocre GPA.

Excuse the long post.


**1) What do BME majors do post graduation?**

In freshman year there is a class that brings in BME alumni once a week to talk about their careers post-graduation. The breakdown is roughly

* 1/3 go to professional school (Med and Law)
* 1/3 go to grad school for PhD or masters
* 1/3 go into the workplace (big pharma, tech startups, medical device, consulting, etc.)


**2) Will BME "tank" my GPA?**

In general, college will "tank" your GPA, especially at Hopkins. On top of your classes being more difficult, you will also need to adjust to living independently and perhaps new study skills.
Yes the BME major, like all engineering majors, requires many credits (129) and challenging classes (SBE I is a killer and rite of passage). However, please consider

* Unless you AP out of general chem, physics, calculus, and have transfer credit for lin alg and diff eq, you are going to be taking these freshman/sophomore year. Most other engineering majors and science majors also take these classes.
* Classes in the BME department are notoriously difficult, but they get curved very generously. My molecules and cells (BME version of biochem) class was curved to a B+/A-. The average was 76.5.


**3) What is the best major for med school?**

There is none. I've spoken with med school admissions staff who visit campus (one was on the board of AAMC) and they all say that the choice of major *does not matter* as long as you take all the necessary pre-med coursework (i.e. physics, orgo, biochem, bio, etc.). There are way too many pre-med students who have near perfect GPAs than there are spaces at med schools. Your strategy should be to do well in those classes (almost all of which are outside the BME department) so you can ace the MCAT, get research/clinical experience (med campus labs always welcome free labor), and demonstrate that you genuinely care about people (volunteering/community service is a must). Furthermore, you need to show that you are an interesting person who is committed to a life long career of nonstop learning. All of this can be done regardless of major.


BME is a good fit for you if you like math or at least won't hate it when it shows up in your "biology" classes. There is a stronger emphasis on problem solving than on knowledge. My roommate is a pre-med neuroscience major and his classes are not easy either. Nervous systems I and II are taught by professors who also teach at the med campus. Around 20 pages of material are covered per lecture.


There is one *rumored* statistic about BME and med school success rates, but I have no way of verifying it. Apparently ~40% of hopkins undergrads who apply to med school get in. ~70% of BME's who apply to med school get in. It's possible that doing the major helps with admissions, but also equally likely is that the BME department's reputation attracts very strong students into the program in the first place.


Feel free to ask me more questions. Being pre-med comes with a lot of information and misinformation that can't be fully addressed, even in this long post.
You should also be added to the class of 2021 fb group as well as the class of 2021 BME fb group. There are many people who will be happy to help.

2) Being somewhat conservative is fine. Any school you go to will have people challenging your beliefs but that's what college is about. You won't face any hostility.

3) There is an option to take classes with the Peabody Conservatory of Music. For the most part, though, taking classes at other schools would only happen over the summer. You'll find Hopkins has most if not all of the classes you would want to take.

4) There are distribution requirements for majors but they're not hard to get rid of. Engineers have to take a certain number of math classes, for example. I'm a neuroscience major and I'm required to take physics and chemistry and some math courses, but that's just so I can understand the upper-level material. There is a good amount of freedom in choosing classes. I'm allowed to choose which upper-level neuroscience courses I want to take based off a list of approved classes. My roommate's an economics major and he simply has to take a certain  number of econ courses but most are not required.

5) The JHU community is very friends. It is a top tier college and people work very hard so we don't have the most school spirit but most students find their group(s) of people and are very happy. We have over 300+ clubs/organizations, so there's for sure multiple groups you'd enjoy.

6) Dorms are pretty good. Sophomore housing is great. The food isn't bad. The freshman dining hall is a buffet style and it's pretty good. There are many options everyday.

7) Not at all. Homewood campus is almost exclusively undergrads so you really don't feel any postgrad pressure.

Feel free to DM me if you have any other questions.</commentText><authorName>Toasteroven16</authorName><authorID>lyuls</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1480637696.0</commentCreated><commentID>danqc1f</commentID><commentText>I'll a graduate student who didn't go here for undergrad but I figured I would answer what I could.

1) Of the undergrads I've talked to, switching majors seems just as common as any other undergrad.  Sure it may seem at first that everyone is pre-med destined since elementary for med school, but that doesn't mean there aren't options to change your mind.  The school has good career counseling services available.  However I will note that JHU is a small school and it seems most degrees are medically focused.  If you don't think focusing on human health is your thing, maybe consider elsewhere.

2) You are going to face people challenging your views no matter what campus you go to, and not because your conservative but because college is a time for you to mature in your opinion and discuss them openly.  I have found JHU to be more cordial than my undergrad though.  I'm more liberal and both the conservatives and liberals here have made well educated discussion here.  No one will be hostile unless you are hostile to them.  Yes we have safe spaces and affirmative action and things are general slanted liberal but its definitely not as extreme as my undergrad where protestors are out across campus and doing sit ins because there is a racial imbalance among the staff.  Here there are lots of open forums and efforts by the staff to have civil discussion.  It's nice.  But as always you don't have to be involved and most aren't.

3) I don't know / doesn't apply to me

4) I dont know / doesn't apply to me

5) I would say JHU personality is "busy".  People all work hard and there isn't much free time or party life here.  Lots of people locked in study halls all day.  You will make plenty of friends but, again, this isn't a large school.

6) the dorms are expensive and the food is awesome but also expensive.

7) There is no emphasis on graduate education but in my experience you will get to have classes and work with grad students who will have a lot to add to your education.  I'm only speaking from a biomedical engineering major though.  I'm not sure about other majors</commentText><authorName>FreeRunningEngineer</authorName><authorID>eh5fq</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1480636659.0</commentCreated><commentID>danpi6c</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1480679858.0</commentCreated><commentID>daon623</commentID><commentText>1.) The only major that is different is BME. You need to apply separately. Otherwise, it's easy.

2.) I am conservative, had no complaints during my time there.

3.) Dual degrees are possible. I did BME (from the engineering college) and Neuroscience (arts &amp; sciences). It was difficult, but doable.

4.) Very few, that's why I liked it. As an engineer, I only had to take 18 humanities credits. It's different if you're pre-med, but that'll be the same everywhere.

5.) Yes. Not sure how to describe the personality. You will most likely find your own group of friends and hang with them.

6.) Dorms are ok, best is Wolman for freshmen and Charles Commons for sophomores. Rest are meh. Food was meh but it got better right after I graduated, apparently.

7.) Depends. If you try to work in a lab, be careful of the lab that you pick. Some of them have PIs that only care about their grad students and won't pay attention to you. Same with some of the professors who do research. For the most part, this wasn't a problem.</commentText><authorName>CrypticParagon</authorName><authorID>8qq4c</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1480998866.0</commentCreated><commentID>datrrni</commentID><commentText>Current Student as well: 

1) Super easy and lots of our programs our top 10 in the nation in non-sciences. Off the top of my head International Studies, History and Writing Seminars are all highly rated.

2) Nah you're fine. There are tons of conservative people though I will say it's got a heavy heavy coastal bias (source: am midwestern)

3) You can take classes from tons of department in 3rd and 4th year you take classes at the graduate public health school but honestly there are so many dope classes it's unneccesary.

4. Few distribution requirements and tons of classes fall into categories. Also, you can usually get your major to override a class or two if you make a decent argument about distribution.
 
5. It's friendly. I especially like non-science kids because science kids while on the whole great can be a bit dull and too focused on future careers.

6. Freshman dorms are meh. I hated the food but I love cooking for myself. Sophomore dorms are fantastic.

7. No. In fact, it allows you to do tons of incredible research if you're into that sort of thing.

The grading is still a flat curve where you need a 80(or 85)% for an A, 75% for an A-, 70% for B+... and so on. 

I didn't find the material too hard but I also took AP physics in high school. What I did do is refer to a lot of YouTube videos especially for the concepts later in the semester because the material was difficult to understand without doing problems. 

To be successful, do a lot of book problems and hw problems because they really test to see if you understand the concepts. </commentText><authorName>you_are_who</authorName><authorID>csboj</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1478399233.0</commentCreated><commentID>d9n4lr6</commentID><commentText>Physics for bio is way easier, I used to compare homework with friends in it and they didn't learn stuff nearly as in depth as we did in the engineering class.</commentText><authorName>CrypticParagon</authorName><authorID>8qq4c</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>5azy70<comments><comment><commentCreated>1479535418.0</commentCreated><commentID>da68ojk</commentID><commentText>Hi, if you get into places like GTech, Purdue, CMU, MIT, UCLA etc then go there.

The first couple of months can be really rough.  Have you been reaching out to people in your classes?  I made some of my best friends in class.  I sat next to people I sort of knew from the dorms and we started studying together, grabbing lunch, etc.  I also had great experiences in seminar classes.  Also, do the clubs you joined have weekly meetings or activities?  It's a lot easier to make friends when you have weekly meetings/practices/hiking trips to build up familiarity over time.  </commentText><authorName>hopelepoh</authorName><authorID>9vxtm</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1476716739.0</commentCreated><commentID>d8vfndr</commentID><commentText>One thing that really helped me make friends at Hopkins was to grab food with people at the FFC - invite your roommates/hall mates/class mates to grab lunch/dinner/late night. But more importantly, don't stress out about not having a "tight knit friend group", especially only one month into your college career.

For now, just focus on what you wanna do outside of class - research, drama, a cappella, programming, etc. Whatever extracurricular you decide to do, you'll find people who have something in common with you.</commentText><authorName>JaptainCackSparrow</authorName><authorID>cvxci</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1476750765.0</commentCreated><commentID>d8vw6oc</commentID><commentText>Honestly it's still in the process of getting better for me and I've just started my sophomore year. I've met some really cool people this year and am having a much better time than last, so I wouldn't worry about it! I totally get where your coming from&#8212;though I had some friends none of them felt very close or relatable, I had trouble really fitting in with my suitemates and ended up spending most of my time hanging out with my boyfriend's roommates instead, I joined some clubs and made some friends that I really only talked to at the club meetings. I really didn't like it and spent a lot of time thinking about transferring this summer. 

But after coming back for this semester things have been getting better! I met someone who is really cool and we talk about a lot of weird things I didn't get to talk with other people about like the first time we met and now we have lunch about every other week. I'm more known now in my clubs so those people have become friends outside of club meetings as well. So don't worry about it! It's only your freshman year and making friends is hard. It'll work out :) Best of luck!</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1476840602.0</commentCreated><commentID>d8xhh7m</commentID><commentText>I didnt even meet my closest college friends until 2nd semester and didn't hang out with them a lot until sophomore year. My first semester as a Freshman, I mostly hung out with my roommate and people in our house. We didn't have a ton of similar interests, but they were close by and everyone was nice. 

Later on, I started hanging out more with people who have similar interests as me or who I saw more often. I spent a lot of free time at the gym playing basketball, so I got close to some people I frequently saw there and played with. Plus a couple who were also engineers so were in same/similar classes. I also played club sports and met some friends through that.

In terms of general advice:

(1) Do as many problems from the relevant sections of the textbook. 

(2) understand every definition and theorem that was covered in lecture. This is not the same as knowing or being able to write them down. To cement this understanding, you should have both positive and negative examples of definitions and theorems.</commentText><authorName>kurtosis312</authorName><authorID>4l63j</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>53l81k<comments /></submission><submission>53j6aj<comments><comment><commentCreated>1474366579.0</commentCreated><commentID>d7u1sg5</commentID><commentText>Can you provide a little more information?

But, I'll try to address some of your points.

1. Greek life is a fairly large part of the party social scene, but there are many many non-Greek clubs and organizations in which you can immerse yourself. But if you enjoying drinking and socializing, you'll need friends who are willing to leave the main Homewood campus area to head to the areas with lots of bars. Otherwise, it's house parties and frat parties. As a transfer in, you probably wouldn't be attending many frat or sorority parties anyway because you wouldn't know any members. But you've said that's something you'd like to get away from, so the bottom line is, if you make other friends, you'll be able to have plenty of fun without JHU Greek life.

2. Living off campus is totally fine, with or without friends. There are lots of decent places to live near the main campus, and you'll make friends who you can go see on campus or off campus.
On a side note about living off campus, burglary is a real problem the farther from Homewood you go. It's not like you're  living in a bad neighborhood, but so many students live in the area and so many students have nice computers and TVs, so the area, in spite of proximity to the main campus (and all its attendant security), is a natural target for burglars. 

3. The honest answer is that it can be difficult to break into the Hopkins community at any stage. You have to want to make friends and be willing to work to make them because so many students are so driven and frankly less concerned with making friends. Personally, I think it has a lot to do with your major of choice and the kinds of people who choose respective majors as well as the rigor of your major. 

4. Only advice would be to really do your research about your major and your interests and see if they are reflected at Hopkins. Are there clubs you can join? Are there organizations and societies that interest you? How passionate are you about your major? Does Hopkins offer your major? If you don't like Greek life, the answers to these questions will lead you away from it and to people who share similar interests (aka friends). But, there's a good chance you'll have friends in Greek life. In my experience, it was more or less unavoidable to have some fun. But if you can tolerate a certain degree of Greek life and are an active outgoing person, you can have a lot of fun at JHU and can get a great (but damn expensive) degree as well.

Hope that helps and good luck. Feel free to PM me if you have specific questions in mind.</commentText><authorName>Comogia</authorName><authorID>9bpbp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1474459630.0</commentCreated><commentID>d7vlu9y</commentID><commentText>I have many friends who are transfers. I think that as a junior, you'll find the social scene is not so Greek-centric as it is for freshmen/sophomores. Also, they have separate orientations for transfer students where they do a lot of things together so from what I've seen, they end up having a pretty tight-knit community. The downside to that is that some of the transfer students who were not as outgoing as others ended up just sticking to other transfers. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can limit your social circle. The Hopkins vibe is definitely very different from USC, so it may fit you better. Good luck!</commentText><authorName>seryner</authorName><authorID>8yyr9</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1475588981.0</commentCreated><commentID>d8d7lmi</commentID><commentText>I was a First Year Mentor for orientation this year and got to work with the transfer mentors as well (they were all transfer students). Here is what they shared with me. 

1) it will be difficult to adjust, especially socially. They mentioned how it was hard during the first semester to make friends and find their "group". You probably won't know anyone unless you already have friends here. 

2) Depending on where you're coming from, it may be a difficult academic transition. Depending on your major and classes, it can seem like your drowning in work. But don't freak out! It's a normal feeling and there's numerous resources you can use to help yourself improve. Learning den, pilot, office hours, TAs, just to name a few. 

3) Don't be afraid to talk to someone. It can be anyone - your RA, professor, a counselor, advisor, friend, classmate, anyone you can think of. While Hopkins is certainly a culture of its own, we are welcoming and look out for each other!

That said, here is my advice if you do transfer. 1) making friends is not hard because we don't like new people. Mainly it's because orientation is when you meet new people. However, I make new friends literally every week (not an exaggeration). You could be one of them! Join clubs, dance teams, study groups, sports! All of these will get you connected with people who might become your best friends. One of my great friends is a transfer. I didn't even know until we'd been friends for a semester. So, there's hope :)

Academically, like I said. It's challenging. But, don't let that discourage you. I'm always inspired by my classmates to push myself to my best ability (although I'm on reddit and have a midterm tomorrow lol). And I use many of the resources available to be a successful student. (You define your own goals and your own success, not other people). 

And if you need someone to talk to, your transfer mentor and RA will probably be your first contact. And then anyone else you meet. Feel free to reach out to them or me. 

I hope this helps! Sorry if it sounds a bit blunt, but I didn't want to sugarcoat it. But, I can promise if you do come here, you will make it through and will make great friends (just takes a bit of time haha). PM me if you have any more questions, I'm happy to share my experience and what I know!</commentText><authorName>you_are_who</authorName><authorID>csboj</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>50wt5y<comments><comment><commentCreated>1473041778.0</commentCreated><commentID>d79c92f</commentID><commentText>I had that too.

If that's not the case, the city is kind of sparse. The Downtown Athletic Club is probably your best bet - it's about a mile south of Hopkins, but a manageable bike ride (and they have decent parking).

There's probably also stuff towards Towson, presumably, and I would guess a crossfit-type spot or two, but the city itself (outside of the waterfront line from Fed Hill to the Harbor to Canton) is kinda barren, to my knowledge.</commentText><authorName>Burnsiah</authorName><authorID>53r2x</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>50judi<comments /></submission><submission>50djvm<comments><comment><commentCreated>1472625140.0</commentCreated><commentID>d738asq</commentID><commentText>It no longer exists since the professor (Gregory Kane) sadly passed away to cancer.</commentText><authorName>ihatelosinglol</authorName><authorID>dn7et</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>50bh4n<comments /></submission><submission>5029g1<comments><comment><commentCreated>1472459301.0</commentCreated><commentID>d70ll1e</commentID><commentText>You need to connect through juniper, that's the way the network is setup, sorry...</commentText><authorName>Solian</authorName><authorID>6lyz8</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1472498559.0</commentCreated><commentID>d712c4w</commentID><commentText>I don't think you can use the windows VPN, but there's a new browser based VPN that you can request access to.

But I digress. JHU is definitely a work hard environment. Lots of people aiming to be doctors so grades are paramount. Professors don't hand out grades so you've gotten earn them. 

School traditions are nonexistent. I've heard other schools encourage more of a familial environment which also doesn't happen here. However, I would say there is a strong bond and camaraderie between the alumni (and some would say arrogance) that I haven't seen from members of other schools. In my conversations between friends and alum, all of us complained about our time, but we wouldn't trade it for the world. Also, city of Baltimore has definitely come a long way, and there are tons of opportunities around the city.

Bottom line, you'll probably find your niche no matter what it is on campus. Ultimately, this also isn't something we can tell you, but something you'd have to experience. I believe we still do overnight visits? I'd strongly encourage that.</commentText><authorName>too_much_snow</authorName><authorID>mqqee</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1472211548.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6x2gzf</commentID><commentText>Although I have only been here one year, the first way I would describe JHU is rigorous.

I do sometimes hear people complain about how depressing it is, but I think a lot of it is what you make of it.

But this will have little to no bearing on your *individual* college experience. I hate to repeat an oft repeated phrase, but college is what you make of it. You will find all kinds of people at JHU, and you get to choose which of them you become friends with. You get to choose what groups and organizations to join. Think about what you want to get out of the school, and look into what each school can do to help you achieve that.</commentText><authorName>aoihvlkja</authorName><authorID>10yq21</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4zkmv0<comments><comment><commentCreated>1472445764.0</commentCreated><commentID>d70d2oj</commentID><commentText>Intro psych, hands down</commentText><authorName>steerner</authorName><authorID>p0vkp</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4zgll1<comments><comment><commentCreated>1472226304.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6x8u07</commentID><commentText>I need more specific information to give you class recommendations, like what other classes you want to take and what your CS experience is.

In terms of time management, start everything as early as possible! You'll probably hear this a lot, but it is absolutely imperative that you do this. It gives you tons of time to think stuff out if you run into bugs and more time to thoroughly test your code. Most importantly, you'll be able to ask your professors questions early on, and not when they're being bombarded by questions from everyone else like two days before it's due. If needed, you might even have time to completely refactor, which I did a lot in Data Structures. I was one of the very few people who actually started early on things (I am by no means bragging, but really, NO ONE starts early on things and it always kills them lol) and it has really shown in my performance relative to the curve, so to speak. I am definitely not a very smart individual or anything like that, but working consistently over a long period of time as soon as the assignment is given really gives you a leg up because you can code cleanly and carefully with a good understanding of what you're doing.

Another important thing is to design your code. If you ever take a class with Amir, he will really show you the importance of this. Have a plan for how you want your code to work, and how it will be broken up to accomplish what needs to be accomplished. Code organization is important! Many people will tell you otherwise or blow off design docs, but this is bad in the long run and will make you dig yourself into a lot of holes when things become complex.

Keep your functions concise, as in each function should literally be just that&#8212;function to do one thing. In object-oriented languages, do this with your classes as well. Keeping code minimal maximizes code efficiency, since you can reuse a lot of code by calling the small functions you've written. This will come up a lot in Intermediate and Data Structures.

Those are the most important things, I think. Also read Effective Java, this will help you impress people in internships like A LOT. (Source: I wish so badly that I had read it before my internship this summer instead of procrastinating it since 11th grade lol.)

I hope this helps!</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4zfyt1<comments><comment><commentCreated>1472116885.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6vhsvg</commentID><commentText>Teach yourself psych?

In my experience, Diff EQ is easier and more about memorization, Calc 3 is more about learning. Diff EQ may make you faster at solving very specific kinds of problems, but Calc 3 will help you understand what you're doing.

I would say that Calc 3 is more fundamental than Diff EQ is. I took Calc 3 the last fall and Diff EQ in spring. Both are relatively easy, despite the fact that I didn't have a very good professor for Diff EQ (one could argue for either, actually, since everyone else seemed to dislike my Calc 3 professor).

I personally don't know much about the classes you're taking, but Calc 3 teaches you the general math that you need to know to understand the stuff taught in Diff EQ, though you really only *need* Calc 2 since Diff EQ (at least when I took it) was mostly about memorizing formulas. (Also, I would highly rec taking Linear Algebra before/while taking Diff EQ.) Calc 3 will help you understand those things and I would consider it much more important to any science class or application than Diff EQ just because you'd be able to understand what you're doing better. Also, Diff EQ is slightly easier (although this may be because I took Calc 3 first), so it might be good to take Diff EQ with those courses just so you can learn Calc 3 better. That being said, Diff EQ does help a lot with recognizing different formats of differential equations that you may need to find solutions to in those classes, and might make you faster at identifying and solving the equations that show up in your classes.</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1471782906.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6q92zn</commentID><commentText>Ok, so I have a bit of a differing opinion. I took the sequence in the usual order people take it (calc 3 -&gt; linalg -&gt; diffeq) and i'm not a chembe, but as a bme i have taken other similar engineering classes (systems, models and simulations, etc). From my experience using math in engineering classes, most of what you need from calc 3 (emphasis on in the context of ENGINEERING classes, obviously not pure math and stuff) is how to take partial derivatives, which you can literally learn in two days. The hard, interesting parts of calc 3 (green's theorem, stokes' theorem) which parkourdeer i think is talking about are also less applicable to engineering classes and more of theoretical note. 

Conversely, even though diffeq may be "easier", I literally used differential equations everywhere in my engineering classes, from the first month of material to the last (for example, i've used it on applications ranging from fourier transforms, stability evaluations, models of drug flow, spring/dashpot movements (lol)). In engineering, you'll eventually realize that differential equations are merely a (vital!) tool to help you obtain deeper insights, much like i'm sure derivation felt like a "tool" to help you solve more interesting problems in calc BC. You'll later see that in your chembe classes, the hard part is getting *to* the differential equation, rather than solving the equation itself.

In the context of your particular situation, i'd suggest taking diffeq first, because it'll be way more of a struggle to pick up those techniques on the fly than to learn how to do partials which is probably most of the knowledge from calc 3 you'll need in the class where calc3 is a prereq.</commentText><authorName>multipless</authorName><authorID>sq9ky</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1471831550.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6qtj8n</commentID><commentText>I'm guessing your taking Gagnon's transport?

When I took it, you're lowest midterm grade was dropped, including the final which was weighted like a midterm. This means if you do well enough during the semester, you don't need to take the final. So potentially not having a final for that class is something too look forward too.

Diff Eq I had a terrible professor for. I also took it in high school and the course was almost exactly like my high school class, so personally I had no trouble in the class. For those reasons, I'm probably not the best judge on the difficulty of this class, but if you're a decent math student, then you'll be fine. My professor also worked 100% off the textbook so the majority of the class didn't even attend lecture. But that'll likely not be the case for you and especially for the first couple weeks I'd suggest attending class no matter what.

Physics wasn't so bad in my opinion. But it all really depends on how comfortable you are with the stuff. Again, I took it in high school. Physics Lab though is definitely easy to do well in for anyone. Also, there's practically 0 time you need to spend outside the lab doing any work for the class, it's all in-class.

Don't know anything about Spanish, have you taken Spanish in high school? If you already know a bit, I'm sure it'll be easier, no idea on workload or anything like that though.

Into Psych is a traditionally easy course because they used the same exams year after year and everyone had back tests. I heard last year that they actually changed the exams which messed up a lot of people. I would guess that if you can get the back tests from the most recent year you'll be good to go, but even if you properly study for the class, I don't imagine it'll be too terrible. Haven't taken it myself, but even my friends who took it last year after they changed the tests said it wasn't so bad. I think this course may also be offered in the spring, or maybe that's just Intro Soc, I can't remember. If you really need it for the MCAT, then so be it, but it's not a med school req, just recommended at some places and you can always self study it for the exam. That's really up to you though, whatever you're most comfortable with. I would recommend this as the first course to consider dropping if you need to.

Intro AMS I also don't know much about. But if you want to be an AMS major, then this is obviously a required course that you can't put off a year. If it's also offered in the spring, then you'll have to look ahead at when the upper level AMS courses are offered and see if that makes sense to do. Probably best to take it now no matter what.

I think you'll be fine with this workload. Biochem will be a bit of a pain, especially in the days leading up to an exam, but Diff Eq and Physics shouldn't be so bad if you have a solid math background/mindset. Psych a tossup, and I don't know about Spanish or AMS. The good thing about Hopkins is how late the drop date is, so stick with it for a bit and see how it goes.</commentText><authorName>DatBlizzard</authorName><authorID>9ktyk</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1471604432.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6nkiop</commentID><commentText>[deleted]

Biochem- crap ton of memorization. Easy B, hard A

Physics I &amp; Lab - Mixed reviews. I feel the kids I knew who did well (myself included) had a strong background from high school. Take active learning, which I see you're doing already
Intro psych - Drigotas got unusually tough with his exams starting 2014 (basically just stopped pulling everything off back tests). Not a hard class overall still. Easy A-, but sort of tough to pull off an A
Diffeq - highly dependent on professor. Dr. Brown who teaches it in the fall is the best guy to take it with. I heard he curves to a B+ and is a great teacher. Wish I took it with him.

When it came time to write my supplementary essay about things I did at Hopkins I basically just referred back to the memories I had made at the summer program I attended. Writing the essay was a cinch and I'm sure it played a part (however minor, but I'd like to think it did) in building a detailed perspective of myself for the admissions committee to accept me, even with non-perfect grades/scores. 


If you can/have the means, go for it. Its a great time and I made a bunch of friends and memories (some of those friends also attending Hopkins who I'll be meeting up with in the fall!). If you can't, it's not really any sort of problem...just make sure you invest your summers wisely doing work and making progress in things you love to do, simple as that.</commentText><authorName>queefing</authorName><authorID>5s3us</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4xn3c6<comments><comment><commentCreated>1471218019.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6h4w8n</commentID><commentText>It's free, but I wouldn't recommend.

I think Data Structures is significantly easier and much less time consuming than Intermediate (I took it with Prof. Amir, which is worth knowing because his classes are typically pretty difficult but very rewarding). In part, it's probably because I learned about good code design in Intermediate since it's something that my professor really emphasized. I would say that if you can take Intermediate with Amir in the semester you're planning to take it and you're the type of person who's up for a challenge and for learning more, then take Intermediate first. It will make DS super easy! (EDIT: Also, it's important to note that DS is ridiculously disorganized, so it helps to have good coding practices to begin with since it makes it easier to update your code to the changing/vague guidelines for each project.)

EDIT: For clarity, I took Intermediate with Amir; I don't think he teaches DS, but I could be wrong. He teaches Intermediate every other fall (so the odd years) and Distributed Systems in the even falls.</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1471063815.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6f2h35</commentID><commentText>I don't believe that Yair will be teaching intermediate (he's teaching distributed systems this semester). But parkourdeer is right, intermediate is significantly harder. Intermediate does really teach good programming practice though (you use valgrind, gdb, write makefiles, MUST code in emacs or vim instead of a cushy IDE, etc.) but the actual syntax and stuff is less relevant to your future, whereas in DS you just implement a bunch of (really important) data structures in java, which is easier but also much more imperative to remember and absorb.

In short, Intermediate makes you a better programmer whereas data structures teaches you important things to have in a programmer's toolkit. Honestly, just take whichever you want first.

edit: changed data structures to intermediate. Yair has never taught data structures at jhu; my bad!</commentText><authorName>multipless</authorName><authorID>sq9ky</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1471247252.0</commentCreated><commentID>d6hnphc</commentID><commentText>Speaking as a former TA for data structures (for 5 semesters), taking intermediate first will give you a nice background in solving more complicated problems, but given that the problems you're solving are somewhat different between the classes it would really only be necessary if you aren't confident in your coding ability.

3. The teacher won't let you take the class.

Don't switch to Intro to Business--too time-consuming; IFP is a good option. This is freshman fall, and even though you're ready to work hard, you should still leave time for fun/adjustment to college while you still can.

The campus is more or less bike friendly but you'd need to learn a couple alternative routes to make it around everywhere on a bike (mostly the Gilman tunnel... I think that should get you close enough to anywhere you need) because there are lots of stairs.

Just wanted to add 1 thing: pedestrian traffic. From one end of campus to the other is ~15 minute walk between classes, which means weaving between other people/getting stuck behind slow walkers. From 9am to about 3pm most classes are going on, so the pedestrian traffic will be the heaviest, and maneuvering a bike can be difficult. I've seen people do it w/o a problem, but sometimes bikers/skateboarders need to go out of their way to avoid pedestrians. I'd say more importantly is your commute to campus; if you plan to live far from campus (EX: Homewood, Guilford, etc.), a bike would be handy.

Groupme is not affiliated with the university. It is a messaging service that has been used for us to get to know our future classmates (which we have definitely done). Even if it's as "not right" as you say it is, the university doesnt have the power to shut down a messaging service that it has no ownership over. 

2. Hopkins has much bigger fish to fry....30 or so active groupme participants, who are not indicative of the student body as whole, and who arent really harming any one, is unlikely to draw any sort of adminstrative attention. 

3. Im sorry you feel so strongly against the gc. Scrolling back through it, i find little worth causing any sort of fuss over, which leads me to believe you arent active on it. This confuses me-- why would you feel so strongly about a groupchat you probs dont participate in? Especially if it hasnt done anything wrong. Before complaining, have you tried raising different conversation topics? 

4. Your opinion is not enough to influence the means over which we socialize with each other and kill time before move-in. For me, groupme has removed a lot of social anxiety about heading to hopkins on my own, halfway across the country. I think it's kinda selfish of you to try and shut it down just because you as individual dont happen to like what everyone else decides to discuss. Besides, it isnt really hard to wait out a conversation, mute the chat, change subject, or even leave it if you think it's really *that* bad (although most of us dont think it is)

If you wanted a group chat where all we discuss are Hopkins related things, like the time for move in and the best computer to buy for BME, then you may have been disappointed. Although the big "Hopkins 2020" groupme does have a lot of conversation about things to do solely with Hopkins, there are also some (dare I say bonus) conversations that also come, from some ~interesting~ memes (though if you're on Reddit I'm surprised you're even talking about said memes, since most of them come from here anyhow) to hour long conversations about Pokemon Go. 

So I understand you, OP, if you mean that you are frustrated by friends talking to each other instead of only posting things of extreme relevancy to Hopkins itself. However, I do believe that your post insinuates that you have felt personally affronted by things written there, saying that some conversations are "just not right" and that the administration should shut down the service. I don't think it's ridiculous to ask what we may have done to have offended you. What, specifically, are things that we've said that are "not right"? I think you owe us an explanation before you urge anyone to shut down our communication.

Finally, I'd just like to touch on my own experience on the chat. Similar to the fantastic @jhucogsci, I have also made countless friends as a direct product of being in the big chat. Although I didn't join until 4 months after I got in, I have enjoyed being in it for nearly 100% of the time that I have. I've learned a lot, not only about how big rooms are and how tremendously expensive laundry is (if you're gonna be asking the administration for any more favours, how about you tell them to make prices for necessary things less egregious!!1!1!) but also about my classmates. Sure, I don't like all of them, and even the ones I do like occasionally get on my nerves. But honey, if you can't handle people talking with their friends in a group chat, you've got a big storm coming. Leave if you want, if you don't want just mute it, or confront us if you want us to actually change the way we're acting if it's making you uncomfortable. Just don't hide behind the anonymity of Reddit, post vague subposts, and claim that you're doing the "right thing" without saying anything to back up your claims. Keep in mind that we're just kids having fun and meeting new friends, so hop off your high horse and post some memes. Maybe then you'll actually make some friends.</commentText><authorName>boltman3</authorName><authorID>zgv3j</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1468921598.0</commentCreated><commentID>d5hm0lv</commentID><commentText>To be honest, a lot of the things I've seen said in official Hopkins Class of x groups have been pretty not right. The Yak is also disgusting, though everyone claims to be a troll. People say a lot of offensive things and it sometimes seems to me like the administration is more liberal than the student body, which is kind of gross. In any case, though, I've sort of given up about it because if you speak up people will be like omg!! crazy sjw lol!!! we're just trolling this isn't a safe space!!! and it's just really tiring lol

Anyway, it's up to you if you mind it or not. You can always say something for people to consider and then leave it to them to think about it. If they listen then that's great, and if they don't at least you tried!

EDIT: Just want to clarify that I have opinions and I think some opinions are gross but I don't think people shouldn't have a right to express those opinions/have to have the same opinion as me. Just think that sometimes things don't feel open to discussion at Hopkins, which I'm not really accustomed to, and that I can encourage someone to try and open that discussion.</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4tgyde<comments><comment><commentCreated>1469000403.0</commentCreated><commentID>d5iv355</commentID><commentText>There seems to be some confusion in this thread about the specific course.

Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the actual difficulty of the course; however, I can say that Robbins is a pretty good professor who will do his best to teach you the material (He was my advisor in the department). If you're looking for more feedback on him, look at the survey results for previous classes of 171.106, which he's taught a few times.</commentText><authorName>ProtonFlux</authorName><authorID>g4p5v</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1468915650.0</commentCreated><commentID>d5hi0l9</commentID><commentText>physics for biological sciences is a joke either way... there's no calculus so every problem is just some iteration of one you've probably done before.

I'll just tell you what I paid.

First place : 2 bedroom, 1 bath with 2 people for $1200/month or $600 /person (dirt cheap, shitty apt, Charles Village)

Second place: 3 bedroom, 2 bath with 3 people for $1800/month or $600/person (Whole house, nice area, Hampden)

in both places the highest cost utility is electricity because of AC. Central AC comes to about $90/person/month in the summer and obviously goes to zero in Nov Dec Jan

Water for me about $20/person/month.

Cable is basically only comcast.  Minimum is $30/month for the whole home for just internet.  More standard packages cost is $60-90/month.

Food if you cook is ~$100/month from the grocery store for cheap meals.  

TIPS

I highly recommend Hampden with roommates.  Imho its the best value for price and location.  Mount Vernon and Inner harbor are just as nice but more expensive ~$900/person/month rent.

Charles village is not too nice (few restaurants and bars) and dirt cheap to live ~$600/person/month

North of campus is expensive and ~~shitty~~ no bars or restaurants nearby. Its ~$900/person/month

Anyway thats my experience.</commentText><authorName>FreeRunningEngineer</authorName><authorID>eh5fq</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4rmtk6<comments /></submission><submission>4rfqhe<comments><comment><commentCreated>1467806831.0</commentCreated><commentID>d50z529</commentID><commentText>Holy crap $400-$500 per mo for food?

I went in really excited about the unlimited plan but got sick of the food really early and ended up spending a lot of money on food outside of Hopkins and wishing I had more dining dollars. Switching to the max dining dollars plan definitely reduced my outside spending because there are actually some pretty decent places to eat on campus, like Levering (only for lunch I believe, and the lines get long but they have some pretty bomb sandwiches near the One Bowl station) or Crepe Studio (really good breakfast sandwiches).

That being said, I'm pretty sure I still spent quite a bit on food outside of campus, probably around $200-$300/mo. (but I should check, that could be a bit high?). Some really great places off campus are Chocolatea, Orient Express (the Chinese menu, not the American one lol), and Brown Rice Korean Grill (you can get this on Order Up if you're willing to wait because the wait times fluctuate like crazy). Unimini also has pretty great chicken tenders/fries

EDIT: Also saw people talking about buying groceries at Charmar. Pls save your dining dollars for better things in life and go to Eddie's for groceries. Although one time I bought some clementines from there and they were molding in like 2 days but that's the only time something like that happened and it might have been because I dropped them idk.</commentText><authorName>parkourdeer</authorName><authorID>qo1k5</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1467793653.0</commentCreated><commentID>d50r0hh</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4rfomr<comments><comment><commentCreated>1467842077.0</commentCreated><commentID>d51ct6x</commentID><commentText>you can take a foreign language class.

I graduated in 2011 JHU and then 2013 from Bloomberg so the class number may be different but for me it was: AS.MUSI.376.242

Two writing courses depends on: your classified "hard classes", amount of credits you are taking, and the time left to focus on the writing intensive courses. </commentText><authorName>gazelle5</authorName><authorID>buu6l</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4q5p4j<comments /></submission><submission>4q4uob<comments><comment><commentCreated>1467160481.0</commentCreated><commentID>d4rdcl9</commentID><commentText>I hated Goldberg, but overall your schedule looks typical, you'll be fine.

I think I heard Goldberg is a tough prof? not sure.

Writing Intensives just make sure that none of your major requirements double as WI. I mistakenly took a completely unnecessary WI class my freshman fall. If you don't know your major, put off writing intensive classes for a semester while you decide because you might find yourself in a major where the WI classes are already covered, like in Materials Science &amp; Engineering.

To more directly answer your question, that'll be a pretty manageable workload. Orgo and Calc are tough, but the rest should be pretty easy. I took a similar credit load, made Dean's list and still found time to go out a lot and do a bunch of extracuriculars.</commentText><authorName>my_gamertag_wastaken</authorName><authorID>pb85b</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1466744211.0</commentCreated><commentID>d4lboeu</commentID><commentText>Don't take honors multivariable first semester. If you are considering the double math major, take honors single variable first then honors multivariable. These courses are very theoretical and difficult, and build on each other (they both are proof based), so you would struggle a lot.

Another suggestion, don't take orgo unless you are pre-med. It's not worth it, as the class is made for pre-meds and is curved accordingly (not very much). You are much better off taking other classes in the chemistry department instead, as I think you would find the focus on the actual chemistry, as opposed to memorization, much more fulfilling. A good course would be physical chemistry, as although it is quite difficult, it should be a good challenge rather than a time sink.</commentText><authorName>NerderHerder</authorName><authorID>c19po</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1466744784.0</commentCreated><commentID>d4lc42l</commentID><commentText>I'm pretty into math and I already took multi in high school so I'm taking it again in college</commentText><authorName>colonialbluejay</authorName><authorID>xmbka</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1466818901.0</commentCreated><commentID>d4mi3ju</commentID><commentText>This schedule looks fairly heavy but doable. I didn't take expo writing, since I was able to get writing requirements through other classes. Intro to business was considered writing-intensive (entrepreneurship/management minor), senior ChemBE lab is writing intensive. Chem engineering today is pretty much no work.

My first sem schedule was Chem Eng Today, Orgo, Calc III, Physics + lab, and a history course. On top of this I was on a varsity sports team and a club sports team, so I had practice every weekday and tournaments on many weekends. So I didn't exactly spend a whole lot of time studying. I probably should have studied a bit more. But if you're really into chem and math then your schedule seems manageable.

If it is a basic eight-semester structure where you need to finish with 120, **do not take 17 credits your first semester.**

You will not be doing yourself any favors by making your first semester any more difficult than it will inherently be. I don't doubt your ability. But as a former peer mentor, I cannot tell you how cliche and common it is for incoming students to burn themselves out and have a mental crisis by January.

I would suggest dropping French, which I believe is a 3 credit course. 14 credits (potentially 15 with HEART) will allow you to acclimate at a much more realistic pace.</commentText><authorName>BadEThrowaway</authorName><authorID>wbula</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4oqfyx<comments><comment><commentCreated>1466319358.0</commentCreated><commentID>d4erryr</commentID><commentText>I'm not sure if you can overload, but if I was in your position again I would take as many hard classes as possible.

You also have the option to drop a course without a "W"  by some point in the semester. Personally, I wouldn't take a semester with two lab courses if you could avoid it because it's such a time sink. I think you should reconsider to allow yourself time to explore (extracurriculars, different fields of study, baltimore, etc.) Good luck!</commentText><authorName>MRturnip</authorName><authorID>7l1ik</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1468888707.0</commentCreated><commentID>d5gytnw</commentID><commentText>This may be late but I took gen bio my freshman year and I'm a current rising sophomore taking both labs the next two semesters so yes you're allowed to split lectures and labs</commentText><authorName>forrnaldehyde</authorName><authorID>xptmx</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1466323018.0</commentCreated><commentID>d4etqkw</commentID><commentText>Are you going to have covered grades?

If you will have covered grades, I would say do as much as you can in your first semester. You can knock out some hard classes without really trying, getting straight C's will look the same as getting straight A's. HOWEVER, if you are going to medical school, I have heard that schools write to JHU to get your grades uncovered if it's an important class (like orgo).

I AP'd out of Chem but applied Chem seemed very painful for my friends who took it 3 years ago. They all wished they had taken gen Chem, which is no breeze by itself. 

As for humanities and social sciences I'm a bit biased because it's my second major, but I've never taken a bad political science class. Sure there are some but look at the past reviews (you do know you can do that right?) Choose a good professor and you're golden. My guideline for a good professor is one who gets &gt;3.9 for overall course quality or for teaching effectiveness.

Of course you should take your ap credit, it doesn't cost you anything and can only do you good. Maybe you want to change major some day? Or show a grad school you've taken a stats class.</commentText><authorName>GrimTuesday</authorName><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1465129684.0</commentCreated><commentID>d3wi82s</commentID><commentText>Rising junior BME here.

Addressing each of your questions: 

Whether you'd take Intro Chem or Applied Chem has a lot to do with if you're premed or not. If you're not, definitely take applied chem so you can get it done in a semester and use the second to take something more interesting (you can basically think of it as chem condensed into a semester). If you are premed, take intro chem 1, as you'll need 2 semesters of inorganic chem to fulfill your premed requirements anyway, and you wouldn't want some upper level inorganic chem course to potentially wreak havoc on your GPA.

WRT physics, it doesn't really matter; I took regular physics 1 and AL physics 2 and both were fine, with slight preference towards AL due to the smaller-sized rooms (I think they give the same exams, actually). 

I think applicable credits are automatically applied to your transcript, so no need to worry 'bout that.

WRT electives, popular (but imho boring) ones are IFP (intro to fiction &amp; poetry) and expos. TBH i'd suggest going with your interests and choosing something out there and niche, preferably with a small class size b/c the rest of your classes will be lecture. You like latin? Military history? Homosexuality in the islamic world? Akkadian? (all classes that are available this fall, btw.) Take a class in that department, then!!! (When deciding, don't forget to smash that course evaluations page: [link.](http://web.jhu.edu/registrar/forms-pdfs/Summary_of_Student_Comments_for_Fall_2015_Courses.pdf) A teacher can make or break a course.)

College is precisely great because these tiny classes are available to you. You want a survey of american lit, go on coursera or something. I think taking interesting and different H/S classes makes people more interesting. 

But if you'd like the easy A (read: if you're premed), do IFP or expos and you'll get at least an A- pretty easily. But even that I wouldn't recommend due to covered grades.

Good luck, and i'd love to know what you end up going with! See you on campus next year.</commentText><authorName>multipless</authorName><authorID>sq9ky</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1465218649.0</commentCreated><commentID>d3xq97l</commentID><commentText>(BME '14)

Regarding what classes to take, my short answer is take whatever you want.

For writing intensive courses, IFP 1&amp;2 are pretty easy, as long as you please your TA. Otherwise, scientific writing courses are less "creative" but useful if you want to focus on academia.

Concerning which humanities and social sciences to take, take anything that'll help you make the most of college. If that means taking a language because you want to study abroad, a musical theatre class so that you can get over stage fright, or photography (if you can even get in the class) because you like cameras, you should do it.</commentText><authorName>MRturnip</authorName><authorID>7l1ik</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1465892110.0</commentCreated><commentID>d482746</commentID><commentText>Give https://jhu.semester.ly a shot, it has course evaluations and can help you find good classes to take.

I had him last fall for Orgo I and I thought he was an excellent professor, especially for teaching the principles of organic chemistry. He focuses a lot on molecular orbital theory and other relatively more theoretical topics. I took Orgo II with Falzone and I honestly would have preferred Tovar again, Falzone basically just teaches a bunch of mechanisms straight from the textbook (technically easier but not as interesting of a professor IMO). 

If you're wondering, here's the final grading of last fall along with the percent of the class that got each grade. 

"As far as course distributions, reflected in a raw percentage of all total points (542 total), the averge was 61 with a st dev of 13.  The rough cutoffs and percentages were as follows:

A: 74-100 (26%) 

B: 61-73 (29%)

C: 45-60 (33%)

D: 35-44 (9%)

F: 0-34 (2%)"

Hope this helps.

You have the option of writing a senior thesis and everything. 

Bottom line: I can't say enough good things about the biophysics department. I think my experience at hopkins would've been a lot different and less pleasant if i hadn't switched into the major.

Admittedly it was a function of how the dorm was laid out, the lack of common areas or large open spaces resulted in most people in my hall leaving their doors open most of the time, and people filtered in and out of rooms whenever they wanted (you could just close your door if you wanted privacy). The trade-off is that you have communal bathrooms, and older dorm, and no suite or amenities that come with that. 

Wolman is a newer building, and there are some benefits to the suite layout. My friends who lived there said it was also pretty social since people tended to gather in the floor common area, but you have to try a little harder to bring that together. I think the rooms were very marginally smaller. It's a little further from where most classes are held, but a little closer to N.

However he usually balances the exam grades such that you can fuck up one exam and do fine in the class. </commentText><authorName>StrangeShuckles</authorName><authorID>5jp0x</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4k1cyd<comments /></submission><submission>4ju4oj<comments><comment><commentCreated>1463567612.0</commentCreated><commentID>d39q06p</commentID><commentText>Yeah make an email alias via myjhu&#8212;you are allowed 5 at a time </commentText><authorName>schma13</authorName><authorID>f0edl</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4ju3ko<comments><comment><commentCreated>1463646295.0</commentCreated><commentID>d3ayxo4</commentID><commentText>I wouldn't worry about it.

I like using my JHU email for professional things like job apps and LinkedIn, so I'd really like to not lose it.

As for the journals, unfortunately you do lose online access, however as an alum, you are always able to go into the library and access them using a computer there.

If you go to DoGEE's website you can download the graduation requirements. It will be a little bit trickier in that time line due to prerequisites in math. For instance you would need to find out if your Calc I course for bio counts since in the advising guide DoGEE students take Calc I for Physical Science.

My recommendation is to plan it out in the advising guide and figure out what your course schedule is going to look like. Get started in courses that require a sequence this includes Physics which is a required before you can move on to statics or fluid mechanics, Chemistry which is required before you can move on to actual Environmental Engineering Courses, and four required math courses Calc I, Calc II, Calc III, and Diffeq/Linear Algebra. You are probably going to want to start some of the intro classes this summer if possible, to stay on track.

http://engineering.jhu.edu/dogee/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2016/02/Undergrad-Advising-Manual-2015-2016_FINAL_2.29.16.pdf

Also contact the department for advice on this. The professors in DoGEE are pretty friendly. The department is small and is pretty tight knit.

Edit: One last thing you will need to take at least two upper level classes to determine a focus area. These are listed on page 7 and each represents a different aspect of the department. The Environmental Management and Economics Track is focused on operations research and economics (this was my track), Environmental Engineering Science is the classic side of Environmental Engineering focusing on the science of water treatment and water quality, Environmental Transport is focused on geomorphology and landscape hydrology, and Environmental Health Engineering focuses on the public health side of Environmental Engineering.

First apartment was dope.  Located on 16th floor.  Beautiful views.  It's pretty outdated, but the rent was cheap $465 per person plus utilities.  We had mice and had to trap them.  Second apartment was a 2 bedroom.  I think rent was like $675 per person plus utilities.  Had mice and ants.  I feel like this is a given in most Baltimore apartment buildings.  I was in the R unit both years which had in unit laundry.  

The pool is cool if you use it.  The gym is okay.  Front staff was rude when I lived there.  The huge downside is there are essentially window unit AC which is an electricity hog and does not adequately cool the large apartments.  Then in the winter they use oil heat, and it's fucking expensive.  It was like $300 a month to heat our apartment, and they just "estimate" this number and never prorate your bills for actual usage, ie it is not based on usage but square footage and what they predict the cost of heating fuel will cost.  In comparison I have lived in apartments since with natural gas heat and it has been as low as $30 a month.  So take that into account.  </commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4i797k<comments><comment><commentCreated>1462601452.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2vpgty</commentID><commentText>as long as you retake the same class before you graduate, your grade gets replaced!!</commentText><authorName>scientistslovecoffee</authorName><authorID>5l7pq</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4hldwq<comments /></submission><submission>4hj7au<comments><comment><commentCreated>1462248422.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2q2auu</commentID><commentText>Professor George Oppel was amazing for Politics and Violence, though I'm not sure what topic he's going to be teaching next semester.</commentText><authorName>RexFC</authorName><authorID>c4b1u</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1462258519.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2qa51z</commentID><commentText>People shop around a lot..

Orgo 1: If you want to get an A, probably spend about an 1 hour a day reviewing the current lecture and then the next days lecture. 3 exams and a final. No assignments.

Intro to programming: There are weekly homework sets that get harder as the semester goes on. Expect to devote 1-2 hours during the first few weeks and then 6-8 hours in the last final weeks. Weekly quizzes and 2 exams and a final. 

Discrete Math: I haven't taken it.

Expo writing: Most likely an assignment per week, with 4 big assignments during the semester. Each paper will probably be 5-7 pages long. 

Freshmen Seminar in neuroscience: Haven't taken it, heard it is light in workload.

This schedule is doable. </commentText><authorName>hailfire27</authorName><authorID>3thkr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1462271459.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2qj59f</commentID><commentText>Seems easy</commentText><authorName>KageBakemono</authorName><authorID>9f5vm</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1462410348.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2sn4im</commentID><commentText>I will let you in on a secret, do not take Expos, they are terrible classes.

But it sounds like you're pretty far ahead in math. Maybe take a honors course? I would recommend taking a lot of hard courses your first semester because of covered grades. Diffeq is often a difficult course for people so that's why I recommend it.

I would highly recommend Intro to Probability (550.420) if you are able to. It's a requirement for AMS and CS (for CS you can just take the combined Prob/Stat course, but taking them separately would be a better call). Also, you will open up cool CS upper levels earlier, like Machine Learning.

Also, I'd check out 110.401 Analysis I. It's an interesting course and a great introduction to higher-level math (e.g. proof based). It is also useful for some CS applications (computer vision) and many AMS applications.</commentText><authorName>less_than_100_probs</authorName><authorID>ogszz</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4gx95p<comments><comment><commentCreated>1461928382.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2lmw39</commentID><commentText>I seriously doubt you'll regret making a choice that results in less debt. </commentText><authorName>hard_to_reach_plants</authorName><authorID>a81ja</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1461933098.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2lpobg</commentID><commentText>UVA.

I'm speaking mostly from a grad student perspective (Hopkins loans weren't too bad for me, but I racked up $$$ in Out of State grad school tuition).

UVA has a great reputation.  Too many people go to Hopkins as freshman with dreams of med school only to have them quashed within a couple semesters.

I had to make a very similar decision before I went to college, but for me, it was an easy decision. UVA was in-state, but I knew JHU would be a better school, especially for CS and engineering in general.

The real reason I went to JHU was because of the experience I had at SOHOP. My host was/is an amazing, nice, and welcoming person, and after meeting some of his friends during SOHOP I immediately knew that there would be a place for me at JHU.

I've also visited UVA numerous times while attending JHU, because my girlfriend goes there. While I've had fun at both JHU and UVA, they are definitely different in terms of social life. Here are some pros and cons of both school's social settings:

JHU
Pros:
-Small school means higher chance of encountering people you know at parties
-Plenty of groups/clubs to join, almost all of which hold some sort of party/celebration/formal
-Small campus means most parties are within walking distance
-VERY wide range of people/students
-Don't need a fake (unless you want to go to bars)
-President's pond
-Spring Fair (very relaxing and chill, best time of the year)

Cons:
-Some RAs will bust you if you're not careful (not really something to worry about unless you're going to be loud all the time)
-Some parties run the risk of noise complaints, which involves some sort of fine I believe. This happened to my aforementioned SOHOP host, but he started a GoFundMe and made enough money back to pay off the fine. This can also be avoided by registering your party with JHU somehow? I'm not sure what it entails but I do know it's kind of a process, but if you do it only HopCops will respond to noise complaints, not BCPD. Also, JHU will give you water and animal crackers or something like that.

UVA
Pros:
-Big school, you will meet someone new every night (personally I'm not a huge fan of this; most of the time I meet someone while I'm out that ends up being the only interaction I have with them)
-Parties will basically never get shut down
-Even more groups/clubs with more people in them
-Block Party (I've never seen throngs of people so large in my entire life. Very easy to lose the people you came with, although it's an awesome experience)
-The Lawn

Cons:
-Whenever I visit it feels like I only ever see white people. Which is fine, I'm white too, but it's a little disconcerting coming from somewhere like JHU
-People rarely made an effort to get to know me at parties. At JHU, my friends made an effort to get to know my girlfriend when she visited, so I thought it was a little strange.
-You will need a fake. Everyone goes to bars, it's ridiculous. Trinity (a bar) is hook-up central, and is where most people go to end their night at UVA. This is probably a plus. I don't think JHU has an equivalent to this that I know of (it definitely used to though).
-Going out/getting home can be annoying because the campus is so large. You may have to use public transportation/Uber.


I'm sure I could add more to these lists, but that's all I can think of right now. I'm also probably biased towards JHU, but there's a reason for that.

I hope this helps with your decision!</commentText><authorName>intricatehetero</authorName><authorID>66ap1</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1461953249.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2lw76i</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1461983044.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2mdq8c</commentID><commentText>This comment has been overwritten by an open source script to protect this user&amp;apos;s privacy.

It was for mental health though, so the process might be different for physiological stuff.

Acquiring leave was very easy and took less than a week. The administration was very understanding. In particular, Stephanie Baker in the Dean of Students office (over in Mattin) was incredibly kind and helpful. If you leave early enough into the semester you can get a full tuition refund, like I did.

I just finished filling out the forms for readmission. They were very easy. There were three, one of which had to be filled out by the therapist I see. All that's left for me now is waiting to get called for a phone interview by the counseling center. Plus there's the usual Hopkins stuff, like filling out financial aid paperwork, etc.

In my case, because I left so early in the semester my incomplete classes were taken off my transcript, which was great. I'm not sure what happens if you leave earlier in the semester though.

Hope that helps

Edit: I should also mention that I was going semi-regularly to the counseling center at the time. I don't remember too well but that may have helped speed up the process of leaving. I'm pretty sure it didn't help, but I'm mentioning it for sake of completeness</commentText><authorName>DudeMeister300</authorName><authorID>rlkug</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4fbzlw<comments><comment><commentCreated>1461231804.0</commentCreated><commentID>d2b61qm</commentID><commentText>To people thinking of living in the Nine East 33rd building...fucking why? </commentText><authorName>StrangeShuckles</authorName><authorID>5jp0x</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4f8r01<comments><comment><commentCreated>1460962491.0</commentCreated><commentID>d26uerp</commentID><commentText>You could try Old Bank (in Hampden) or Beatnik (near Peabody).</commentText><authorName>Absox</authorName><authorID>5nuv4</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1460963186.0</commentCreated><commentID>d26utd5</commentID><commentText>Faced similar challenges.

The CS department here is small but the faculty is great with some better at teaching than others but this is the case at every university. But that's only half the reason of why we have professors. One thing I like is the amount of research happening here. If you're into ML, NLP, security, robotics, genomics, and even "computational" bioengineering then you're in a good spot. 

I haven't felt any cutthroat at all in my time here. Now there most likely is cutthroat culture if you going into premed and take orgo or nervous systems but we in the CS department are a tight knit community. Lot of us hang out in the CS lab and you can bet there was a upper classman hanging out there who took your class and can lead you in the right direction if you're stuck.

Just keep in mind that JHU is a academically rigorous school. Our upper-level CS classes are definitely up there in terms of rigor. We also run a hackathon here called HopHacks biannually. You might also wonder what alums and what internships people get. I know/heard of people who have gone to work at Palantir, Google, Facebook, Youtube, Bloomberg, Microsoft, Dropbox, etc. as well as lots of people getting internships there.</commentText><authorName>curious_neuron</authorName><authorID>wqqfh</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1463532322.0</commentCreated><commentID>d38zd31</commentID><commentText>Personally I'm glad I did computer engineering and not cs because I got to stop at 5 cs classes. Cs at jhu is too theoretical for me. I didn't care about research, I just wanted to know how to code, but stuff like ai and automata were mostly or fully theory rather than coding. I learned more in non cs dept classes like robot sensors and actuators, ece design team, electronics design lab, even hop hacks, stuff where you actually have to code a project. I don't expect to ever use a reduction proof when I'm making apps at work

After intermediate it gets too specific/theoretical (like machine translation or compilers) and I'm glad I didn't work myself to death trying to pass those classes for a cs major. Got a job as a software engineer so I didn't even need them anyway. 

If you do want to do more theoretical stuff then there's plenty of options though. </commentText><authorName>ikahjalmr</authorName><authorID>6a67s</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4cxa3q<comments><comment><commentCreated>1459570597.0</commentCreated><commentID>d1m7pkz</commentID><commentText>philosophy of space and time sounds dank, but i haven't taken it.</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1459577242.0</commentCreated><commentID>d1mc4p2</commentID><commentText>Sociology of Disability if it is still offered</commentText><authorName>topower86</authorName><authorID>5s2ag</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1459744263.0</commentCreated><commentID>d1ogh03</commentID><commentText>I would *strongly* advise against biochem and nervous system together.

I am a PhD student at Johns Hopkins. Currently Hopkins has no policy to issue a written appointment letter to their Graduate Student Research Assistants. I brought up this issue with the Deans. Here is the Assistant Dean Christine Kavanagh's response to my questions:
1. When a faculty appoints a new Graduate Research Assistant, what procedure needs to be followed?
a. Students are not appointed as GRAs, as students aren&#8217;t appointed (they are admitted). [some unrelated wordy part removed] If there is an arrangement of an additional role (TA, GA, RA) along the way, the faculty/dept./center and student should discuss terms and then it is best practice that it is followed up in writing (email is sufficient).
2. Should he send a letter to the Dean's office intimating the appointment of a new GRA?
a. Not required, [removed].
3. Is it mandatory to give a formal letter of appointment to the student receiving a GRA?
a. No it is not mandatory to have a formal letter,[removed].
After this, you should look at the response of Vice Dean of Education, Whiting School of Engineering're response below (arranged chronogically):

Dear Dr. Scheinerman,
[some unrelated content removed]. In other universities I studied in USA, there was clear documentation, written letter stating the terms and conditions of a GA/RA. But, here there is none.
Do you think this policy of JHU is correct?
Please answer.
Thank You,

also i switched to cs anyway so the flair is old. but when i got into bme my dad was actually proud of me for once.

i wanted to be a doctor at first so that's why i chose jhu over the other schools (plus it's ranked like 16th in the world when i was a senior in high school).

My company encouraged me to pursue a part-time Masters while working.

Traditionally, my peers applied to "Big 10" Midwestern public universities (UIUC, UW Madison, Iowa State, Purdue, etc.).  They're great engineering schools, but weren't a good fit for me.  First and foremost, since I was going to be a part-time distance student, I didn't want to be lost in the crowd and just another student ID on a professor's class roster.  Secondly, I wanted the opportunity to carve out a Master's program useful to my interests and career.  Otherwise, what's the point?  Most part-time programs I found at large state schools are "one size fits all" with little freedom for choosing classes, or a limited selection of courses are available to part-time/distance students.

I came across Johns Hopkins' Engineering for Professionals (EP) program through random Google searching and applied.  I felt like I was taking a bit of gamble at first.  The application process felt a little too easy and I was worried that being in the Midwest, JHU might lack the name recognition compared to local state schools like UIUC or Purdue.

In the end, I went with JHU's program.  They have a ton of courses available to EP students.  The class sizes are refreshingly small (&lt;30 students).  Although professors for the EP program appear to primarily be adjuncts, they actually teach the course and most work for the JHU APL.  One semester in and I've really come to like the program. </commentText><authorName>engineer_jonathan</authorName><authorID>pk8lc</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4brq5t<comments><comment><commentCreated>1458864692.0</commentCreated><commentID>d1bwj1l</commentID><commentText>BA in Econ.

then again, that's just my experience, and isn't necessarily reflective of jhu. </commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1458459513.0</commentCreated><commentID>d1667wq</commentID><commentText>The feminism, hands down</commentText><authorName>KingSpartan15</authorName><authorID>7ejdi</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4b36xh<comments><comment><commentCreated>1458428013.0</commentCreated><commentID>d15p17r</commentID><commentText>Yes you can.

If D'Souza still teaches it, she assumes you already know at least orgo 1. I think the best choice is to take it after orgo 1 and 2. Mostly because sophomore year is usually the hardest for mol cell - you have biochem, orgo 1 and 2, and cell bio at least usually. If you push the lab back a year, junior year is usually easier, more time, plus you get a refresher of orgo for the MCATs, if that's the route you're planning on taking. 

That being said, taking lab in the summer is good too, because summer at JHU is awesome, and it'd (likely) be your only class. Not to mention Klein is a great teacher, and only teaches in the summer. He literally wrote the book 90% of schools use, so that's a big help!

The lab is not hard but it takes a lot of time, I feel that taking it concurrently places a lot if stress during the semesters. This way you go into the lab with knowledge of all the material and you get all the time you need to get it right.

I feel that these are one of the course combos that are really tricky, but can be a lot safer with the appropriate time management.</commentText><authorName>topower86</authorName><authorID>5s2ag</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>495rgo<comments><comment><commentCreated>1457279187.0</commentCreated><commentID>d0pf3do</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>48u96q<comments /></submission><submission>48q318<comments><comment><commentCreated>1457003834.0</commentCreated><commentID>d0lldl0</commentID><commentText>Messed up the title earlier.

Nowhere near as popular as BME, ChemBE, or any of the bio majors here at JHU, the ECE department is one of the smallest, both in size and in funding. The school's not renowned for its Electrical Engineering prowess. You probably already know this.

But being a small department actually does have its advantages. Im a sophomore and my classes have already gotten down to like 15 students total. Signals, which is a class required for the major (so it has basically all the sophomore ECE's) is around 25 students in size. The professors are also pretty chill (imo) and easy to reach. Well, I guess that's not really exclusive to our department. But it's definitely a lot more casual being in an ECE class where there aren't several dozens of other students the professor needs to keep track of. Like if you want to do research as a freshman it's super easy to just email a professor and get going right away. Barton Hall is also going through some renovations; they're doing some major stuff out front and they just added a new optics lab along with the lounge remodeling. Did I mention that we have a kickass lounge? Other departments have like a couple of couches in the corner of the top floor of their building. I think only CS student lab can compare. There's always students chilling there, impossible not to make friends with all the other ECE peeps. Actually I'll also say that JHU's small size is a definite advantage over all the schools you listed (except MIT I think). Our engineering program is also *super* flexible. My friends at large state schools complain about trying to switch majors or having to take a required class at 8PM or something. But literally all you need to switch majors here is to fill out a slip of paper. Humanities/SocialScience requirements are also pretty lax. 

If you make an objective comparison you'll probably find that MIT and Cornell are clearly better than JHU in ECE. Purdue and GATech may also be ranked higher in engineering? I dont think they carry the same name recognition as JHU though, since we're 10th (?) overall and get the most funding in research. And these public schools are like 5 times larger too. 

You should get in contact with an upperclassmen if you want a more experienced perspective. But I will say I don't at all regret my decision to come here. In the end it's not *really* that big a deal what school you go to for a specific major. If you try hard enough you'll find opportunities to succeed no matter where you go. The best thing you can do is pick the right school based on location, size, campus, and other preferences.</commentText><authorName>EpicCelloMan54</authorName><authorID>bqbhi</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1456375592.0</commentCreated><commentID>d0ce6n5</commentID><commentText>/u/rubberduckranger</commentText><authorName>Laminar_Boh</authorName><authorID>m6hws</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1458296839.0</commentCreated><commentID>d142t7o</commentID><commentText>I don't know about other schools but I can tell you that I call every one of my the ECE professors I know by their first names haha. I even address our department chair by his first name too! It's very easy to get to really know them if you want to. There are also many opportunties available if you want to work with them, like there is this professor I didn't even know and I just straight walked into his office one day and said if I could join him and do work with him and stuff and he said yes. the gist of this is that there an advantage of our department being small, mainly ease of opportunties and getting to know professors. Mind you, Hopkins ECE won't be a giant like Caltech or Georgia Tech that dominates in all aspects of the field, but the things we have, we are good at. I'll direct you to this http://lcsr.jhu.edu/ this is basically our robotics lab, they offer a robotics minor and master. We are one of the best in the country in this and along with a few other things in the ECE field. definitely come visit and get a feel for our department!

This makes it really easy to get info about classes, make study groups, make drinking/partying friends, etc. The classes themselves range from great to shit, so it's kind of a tossup, and also depends what you want to do after graduation (which is hard to know right now). Also it's easy to add a CE major if you just do some programming classes, which then opens you up to software jobs.

However, the Penn line will take her directly to Penn Station, which is about a 20 minute walk from campus. She has two free bus options, one paid bus option, can easily bike, and in the worst case scenario can get a cab or uber for about 5 dollars. Also, if I remember correctly, the Camden line is pretty notoriously unreliable. She can walk to the purple line circulator stop, which is probably a better bet than taking the 11 up to campus. The Hopkins shuttle will only pick her up from Penn.

If you want to live in Baltimore, you could actually just take the MARC from Penn to DC every day and it would be less of a hassle than driving. It could also probably be a little more fun than you two living half way and less expensive than you living in DC and having her commute to Baltimore. 

Around campus you're looking at ~700-800 per person a month in a lot of cases, though houses CAN be less expensive. If you're willing to live closer to Penn Station or on 27th street (jhmi picks up on 27th and Saint Paul), it will be less expensive. A lot of people will try to discourage you from living that far away from security, however you will be totally fine.

Since you seem to know a lot of people, first decide which of them you'd like to be a better friend with.

Now ask a favor of them.  Help move something, get a ride somewhere, paint your fence, etc.  I'm sure you would love to help somebody out by doing them a favor.  They probably will feel the same way.  Just don't be a jerk.  Then you can repay them with beer and pizza which you will enjoy together.  Now you are friends.

Are there people from those things you'd want to be friends with? It can be daunting but sit next to someone you'd like to be friends with in class and ask them a question about the material or an upcoming project. I'm not sure what your major is but a lot of people do homework and study together. Honestly a lot of my socialization came from sitting on A level. 

 Talk to people in your clubs. You must have at least on thing in common. Maybe organize a group dinner. That will get you out of your typical setting and allow for conversations about other things. And it's not too late to get involved in other groups.

I'm sorry you think you have to be white and attractive to have friends at Hopkins. I had plenty of non white friends. As for the attractive part, that's all subjective. Plus shouldn't come into the equation for friend making. 

I also want to mention that the counseling center is a great resource. I went for most of my time at Hopkins. It's always nice to have someone to talk to who isn't judgmental and really just wants to help. There are many different types of people to speak with so I'm sure you could find someone you like.

You are basically me in sophomore fall. I realized it sucked, and I started being more social sophomore spring, and I'm about to graduate after spending junior and senior years basically doing things with people every night and weekend, or with opportunities if I wanted to. 

The important thing here has to do with the way friendship works, not JHU itself. For friendships to work, there has to be initiative. So if people aren't reaching out to you, then you need to reach out to people. Ask anybody: the guy you met at orientation, the girl you have a class with, etc. If they are reaching out, learn to say yes and put things off for later (within reason)

Then, learn which connections to stop pursuing (people who fake, don't reply, etc), continue reaching out to the working connections, and then start looking for new ones. Repeat this process until you reach your personal equilibrium point.

You really just have to ask until it works and people start asking back, at which point it's consistent. Ask people to go to PJ's on friday for free tacos and $2 drinks.  Whatever it takes. 

I've seen a lot of people bogged down by commitments, not realizing that although we're at college to learn, it also happens to be one of the greatest social opportunities we'll ever have in our lives. You'll never again be in a situation where basically everybody you see is about your age and going through about the same things you're going through. You have instant conversation material and camaraderie with everybody you talk to. So, all you have to do is keep putting it to use and see who responds positively.

Church is also a way to make friends. I've made some friends through church, but they're not part of my everyday group of friends.

Either way, making friends takes effort and you'll probably have to be the one to approach someone. Keep the conversation casual but fluid. If you can extend it outside of the context and scenario you're in, then I'd say you made a friend.


(Oops I misread your question. It seems like you're looking for a good/best friend. In my opinion a lot of people don't really have best friends outside of childhood best friends and family friends. Someone that you can always talk to and be there for. I'll say that I met a close friend through our weekly smoke sessions. As we talked we realized we connect really well and are just compatible. Not saying you have to smoke weed, but find something you enjoy, and find someone else that enjoys the same thing.

It would also be cool -- but admittedly a massive undertaking -- to map out where all the exits are.

When we were looking for housing we used several resources, but ultimately ended up 'taking over' someone else's lease.  In my experience this is the most common way to get a house because the market is competitive and usually houses have a lineage through some on campus organization and are passed from member to member.  Usually knowing upperclassmen who are graduating gives you an 'in' and they just tell their landlords that they have new tenants lined up, and there isn't much searching.  Not everyone has this option though, and so here are a couple resources we were looking into before we got our house:

* JHU housing and dinning website had some resources
* JHU housing and dinning semminar/presentation
* Searching for management companies in the area (I know American Management is a big one)
* Zillow might give you some ideas
* Knocking on doors of houses that you know students live in (even if you don't know the students) and asking if they are moving out and if you and your friends can take over their lease

All of that is if you are trying to find a house.  If you are trying to rent I recomend contacting the apartment buildings in the area you want to live and asking.  If you think about it you can probably name the buildings, just google the name, find a phone number, and call the management company for information.  Off the top of my head I will list the buildings I remember: 

* Cresmont Lofts
* Village Lofts
* The Telephone Building
* Wyman Towers
* The Blackstone
* The Charles
* The Guilford
* The Varsity
* Uni One
* The Marylander
* Uni West
* Hop House
* The Carlton

I hope this information gets you on the right track, I can be more specific if you can give us a little more information:

* House or apartment?
* How many people do you want to live with?  How many of those do you already know (ie is there a group you want to live with or just you, and if you have 2-3 do you want to be matched with 1-3  more?)
* Where do you want to live?
* How much do you want to pay?</commentText><authorName>GHOST6</authorName><authorID>9at64</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1455599961.0</commentCreated><commentID>d013ew9</commentID><commentText>https://offcampushousing.jhu.edu/</commentText><authorName>irritatedcitydweller</authorName><authorID>gbfws</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1455600139.0</commentCreated><commentID>d013j6y</commentID><commentText>/u/Ghost6 gave some good advice which outlines how most people go about finding housing.

If you're willing to take the risk, another route you could go is to wait until April/May and start scouring Craigslist and other websites with listings. Most college kids try to find housing 5-6 months before they expect to move in, but other people generally make moves within a much smaller time frame so it's likely that spaces will open up around this time. This is a lot riskier than trying to lock something down early but I have friends who have done this and been successful.</commentText><authorName>Georgealing</authorName><authorID>a6lyv</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1463535808.0</commentCreated><commentID>d3924i4</commentID><commentText>Craigslist

I researched competitive programs (part-time, distance engineering programs), and most have more laid back entrance criteria compared to their full-time, thesis-based programs. 

For example, I believe UIUC waves the GRE if you have a &gt;3.2 GPA. Even Stanford, with their Honors Cooperative Program, is alleged to have "easier" acceptance criteria for part-time HCP students. 

I agree, there's probably some self-selection. Engineering Masters programs, especially prestigious ones, probably scare away those that lack the necessary technical skills. Engineering provides a comfortable life, but has never been viewed as an easy/quick path to a lavishly rich life. People going after "easy" money will try their luck at low-tier MBA programs, IMO.

I'm in my first semester so I'm still forming my opinion of the program. That being said, I can say my class mates are bright engineers, most went to prestigious undergrads and work at reputable companies now. The class size is also refeshingly small for an online program. 

My only constructive criticism is I wish the pace of the course was slower and we dived more deeply into the underlying theories.</commentText><authorName>engineer_jonathan</authorName><authorID>pk8lc</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1466130941.0</commentCreated><commentID>d4bxvt0</commentID><commentText>how soon after applying did you hear back</commentText><authorName>farmland123</authorName><authorID>ys5yj</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1455184738.0</commentCreated><commentID>czvj24x</commentID><commentText>I finished my masters in the EP program in Applied Physics.

Not sure if you can do the BBA program at Carey though. It's being removed - http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/bachelor-of-business-administration/

&gt; The Johns Hopkins Carey Business School will be phasing out the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree program over the next two years. Applications for the BBA program will no longer be accepted after Fall 2016. Students admitted for Fall 2016 will complete their degree in May 2018.

And since it's a 2-year program for students who have already finished their core requirements, I don't think it would even be offered anymore once you're ready to apply. Outside of Carey, JHU doesnt have an undergraduate business major. But there is a management minor and an econ major/minor if those are in your interests.</commentText><authorName>hungryhungryhippooo</authorName><authorID>86z7y</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1454837917.0</commentCreated><commentID>czql2hu</commentID><commentText>There isn't even a business major at hopkins...</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1454748227.0</commentCreated><commentID>czphvkg</commentID><commentText>A lot of would be "business" majors major in Economics and/or minor in financial economics so that is an option. </commentText><authorName>gogogadgt</authorName><authorID>dk5tr</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>4484uy<comments><comment><commentCreated>1454752022.0</commentCreated><commentID>czpjxsj</commentID><commentText>The material is fun and interesting, but the class is a lot of memorization and the exams aren't well written from what I recall.

Wouldn't any transfer essay talk about one's reasons for transferring? I think that that the essay is probably inherently personal. Certainly nobody wants to hear: "I want to go to Hopkins because it's better than where I am now" -- they want to hear your actual reasons. I'd say that's pretty personal.

On the other hand, you probably don't have to talk about all of your high school extracurricular activities.

A few of my good friends transferred into the school, and they definitely told me that they'd made the right decision.

My GPA was 3.71 (from Carnegie Mellon in physics). I do not recall my GREs but they weren't great. (and I think they have since changed the system). But either way, they were low. I do not know how I made it past the first round, but I hit it off with my (eventual) advisor once I was there.

By the way, on the off chance you, like me, didn't know this: Every school (and maybe department?) is different in this regard, but getting in is just half the battle. It's the first round. After that, you will want to get an advisor to fund you. That's the second half. In Mechanical, getting in gets you 20% of tuition and maybe insurance. You should never pay for a PhD in a STEM field!

But, other schools will fully fund for the first few years. And, like I said, this may vary with departments too.</commentText><authorName>jwink3101</authorName><authorID>6asud</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>3wvba6<comments><comment><commentCreated>1450249657.0</commentCreated><commentID>cy0c86j</commentID><commentText>If you need a writing intensive class, Intro to Bioethics.

After my first semester I decided I didn't want to go to medical school anymore. I then spent almost the rest of college planning on getting a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, but just graduated in May without applying to any PhD programs and now I'm planning on getting into medtech design. Plans change, and it's not the end of the world if they do.

Ask upperclassmen in your major for advice to see what mistakes they made that you can avoid.

Don't date in your first semester, maybe even your first year. You will meet a ton of people in that first year.

Don't let your grade define your self-worth. This is very common since a ton of people are trying to maximize their GPAs to get into medical school. I'm not saying don't try your hardest, but don't let it mean so much to you that it starts to affect your mental health and you as a person.

In a similar vein, don't let school prevent you from making good friends. I'm not sure if covered grades are still a thing, but if they are, use your first semester to get involved in student groups, make lasting friends, and enjoy college life.

HOWEVER, still study your freshman fall! I didn't really study until college, then didn't study fall semester, then got worse grades than I should have in my freshman spring because I didn't learn how to study when I had covered grades. It's a skill that is different from high school that you need to acquire early.

When making friends, this is a time to redefine yourself if you want to. Were you really shy in high school, like me? Just realize that everyone here is new and nobody knows you; just talk to people and make friends, they are just as nervous for you. Were you a slacker in high school? Ask people to study with you here, get a group around you that helps you maintain good study habits. Be exactly who you want to be on day one.

Sleep.

Lastly, if you think of this as the best 4 years of your life, you are just going to be disappointed when you graduate. Sure you can have a heck of a lot of fun and make lasting memories and friends, but think of all the cool shit you'll be able to do after graduation. You'll have money, you can travel, you can try different careers, get married, so much stuff. So enjoy this and make it fun, but don't have the mindset that your level or enjoyment of life is peaking so early.

OK one more thing that I want to reiterate. Don't let grades define you. Don't high mental health disorders, and don't rationalize having them, especially the sort of depression that people can get at Hopkins. If you start to suffer, tell someone.

Explore Baltimore and make sure you join some organization that connects you to more people. Greek life parties aren't like state schools but the connections are worth it (especially if you're a guy). You get to meet upperclassmen, have tons of people to go to for advice, and get leadership experience if you're looking for it. I'm sure many other organizations outside of Greek life give the same general connections so there are lots of options.

The key to making JHU enjoyable is to build connections. Make friends. Join clubs or do Greek life. Bond with people in your freshman dorm. I'm almost 4 years out, and all my current JHU friends are either (1) freshman hall dormmates or (2) people from my sorority. FWIW i was in a sorority, and now my former sisters are my bridesmaids for my wedding. I also met my future husband (another fellow Greek member) through my sorority sisters. Greek life has had a bad rap as of late, but it's an EXCELLENT way to make life-long connections (and those connections may help you when you're looking for jobs after graduation!). </commentText><authorName>inyoureyes89</authorName><authorID>jbj51</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1450059042.0</commentCreated><commentID>cxxo1i3</commentID><commentText>Honestly, my opinion as a graduating senior...

Let us say a student starts working with a prof whose funding runs out after 2 years or loses tenure. Then the student is still new to the program and he switches to another prof. Let us say, this prof runs out of funding after 3 years. Now the student is a 5th year student, but technically a 3rd year as he had to switch for no fault of his. At this point, he can neither look for another prof at 5th year. But on the other hand, if he continues with the same prof, let us say it takes another 2-3 years to finish his thesis. In such a case, how do you expect the student to afford to fund him/herself for 3 years? Please see that there is no fault of the student here. And the student was never told beforehand that he/she is on their own if the prof runs out of funding. This is why I think a written agreement between prof and the student is necessary.

Not nearly as cutthroat as the rumors suggest; however, we don't have grade inflation like certain other top universities, so A-level work elsewhere can be B- work here. Keep in mind that most classes are graded according to normal distribution. An exam average can (and has been) a 35%, but if you made 40% you're doing fine.

2. Regrets: wasting as much money as I did with the overpriced meal system here. Charmar is the only store in Baltimore that will sell you a bag of squishy grapes for $15.

3. In that case, you might be on the brink. Admission got a lot more cutthroat this year because we rose to top 10 school and so the applicant pool will probably spike (it's already been on the rise). So you'll have to kick butt on those application essays. Don't write what you think they want to hear, write something to make you stand out.

6. Never heard of it but doesn't make it impossible. Keep in mind that they usually like someone with a good grasp of the field, and that even during the summer they have plenty of undergrads/grads/whatever.

3. Yes, depending on how you explain it in your interview and what you write on your application. 

4. ED'ed in. Cancelled all my other apps in December lol. 

5. Krieger is a bit more chill with the social sciences. Definitely didn't study as much as my engineering friends (Looking at you /u/Sgt_Ice_Bucket) 

6. Won't hurt, especially if you are polite and courteous about it. 

7. Be prepared to STUDY A LOT. MSE was my home for many nights. D level was for finals and midterms. Find yourself a nice group of friends, but also make friends with others in your major/department. There are lots of clubs, so don't feel the need to hurry in joining them until you feel comfortable (Shameless APO community service fraternity plug!)</commentText><authorName>Gulagman</authorName><authorID>58qvp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1447148621.0</commentCreated><commentID>cwuttih</commentID><commentText>Hi,

     I graduated in 2014 Mechanical Engineering, had an internship during my undergrad at APL, and am now working part time at the FDA and getting a Masters in Biomedical Engineering at Hopkins still. I also came from Cali : ) 

1. Things that surprised me was the caliber of people here. Everyone in classes want to do well in academics, and "success" in the traditional sense is the norm. In hindsight, this makes sense, but it really shocked me that everyone took academics so seriously compared to my high school.

2. No regrets. Only one minor one: I wish I had joined a hip-hop dance group here earlier. I joined my junior year and am still on it and love it. You should really find an extracurricular activity early on and have it become what you love outside of academics.

3. Really don't know about my friend's SAT score, haha.

4. Had my major of biomechanics, and Hopkins had the reputation of doing cutting edge research in the biomedical field as well.

5. Whiting is definitely more rigorous meaning harder classes and more requirements to graduate. That is just objective, not saying Kreiger students work less or are less driven. Most of my friends are from Whiting, however, and we call Krieger the School of Arts and Crafts. : P 

6. Yep go ahead and contact professors directly. Can't hurt.

7. Personal experiences will vary, but at least being an engineer, you know everyone is suffering through the hard classes, and that sort of brings people together. Definitely cannot breeze through a degree here. I know some people really don't like the surrounding city of Baltimore, and I am sort of getting tired of it too and might go back to Cali for a pHD. But I don't regret my decision for Hopkins at all.

Good luck! </commentText><authorName>ribwhich</authorName><authorID>5ku08</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1447158956.0</commentCreated><commentID>cwuzzqz</commentID><commentText>1. Nothing really.  Sister had gone through it already and I lived in the area, so I knew it really well.
2. Probably could have worked a bit harder in classes, but I ended up with good enough grades so it was alright.
3. No idea, but if the rest of your application is strong they'll probably overlook a sketchy GPA.
4. Applied because it's a great school for biology and biological research, attended for the same reasons.
5. Krieger and Whiting have vastly different majors so you can't really compare them.
6. Depends on the professor but overall yes.  I know every year Baltimore City high school students do research in various labs throughout Hopkins.
7. I'd say the community is large enough that you can find an open friendly group and you can also find really closed off groups.  </commentText><authorName>water_in_the_forest</authorName><authorID>e8rkg</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1447195674.0</commentCreated><commentID>cwvbxnj</commentID><commentText>I graduated with a double major and masters in engineering and math.  I currently work at APL, but never interned there as a student.

1. I applied ED without ever visiting the school.  My parents didn't have very much money, so the option of visiting schools was off the table.  I came from the Midwest, and holy crap the east coast was very different.  I lived in a very antisocial living situation my first year and struggled to make friends in the beginning.  My first 6-7 months at JHU were miserable, but things got better.

2.  I got a good scholarship package, but holy crap the school is expensive.  I really don't think it's worth the $60k+ price tag.  At least in my field coming from JHU doesn't get you anymore recognition.  Not really a regret, but if I came out of school with $100k or more in loans I would be miserable right now.

3. I worked in admissions for 3 years, so I have some insight here, but nobody can tell you how to get in.  I slacked off in high school some because I was really unmotivated, and I hated the environment.  I think my saving grace was I took my final year of courses at the local university (not community college, admissions views these things differently.)  I ended up taking university math, biology, physics, french, and some history of science courses.  I think that showed I was really dedicated and willing to push myself.  If you are applying for a hard science or engineering you really need to take the highest level in those subjects your school offers.  In addition, you should also stay well rounded so take a language, AP history, or music classes if you can.  If your state offers free post secondary education at your local university, do it! It was completely free for me, and it really helped me prepare for university level course work.  Lastly, work hard on your essays.  Don't write anything trite or cliche.  Spend a lot of time thinking about what makes you unique and differently.  Seriously, spend time thinking about it a lot so you know what you can highlight in your essay.  Great essays are important.  

4.  I was interested in cell engineering.  They had a pretty specific program for that, where as many other schools didn't.  

5.  I was in both.  There is literally no difference, except what your diploma says.  Maybe you need to take a few more credits to graduate depending on your engineering degree?  Either way, engineering students take classes in the arts and sciences, and arts and sciences student can take classes in the engineering school.  However, I should point out that the math degree is a BA, not a BS so it is not science intensive.  Applied math is in the engineering school, so it is a BS.  Lots of people double major with pure math, ie physics and math, chem and math, EE and math, etc.  Mostly, physics and math though.  

6.  Always worth a shot.  Professors are busy.  Some just won't give you the time of day, and others are really eager to help interested students out.  It varies a lot.  Only downside is since you're only in HS, it is hard to come up with projects at the HS level for interns.  

7.  A lot of my socializing revolved around hanging out at the library with peers doing homework.  I didn't have very much free time. It kind of bewilders me now how I survived with so little sleep.  Life is much sweeter with 8 hrs a night.  </commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1447805343.0</commentCreated><commentID>cx3dqoc</commentID><commentText>Just graduated with a PhD in physics.  I can't offer a perspective on the total undergraduate experience, but I can't, in retrospect, say many good things about this place.  As far as physics is concerned, the undergraduate curriculum is laughably terrible.  What nets you a BS here wouldn't get you a BA at my alma mater.  This is because the registrar wants students to be able to *triple major*, which, frankly, is ludicrous, and so it suppresses the number of requirements for a specific major.  The research front is strong enough if you're wanting to enter a PhD program for experimental physics, but don't expect to have a good research or course experience without significantly more work on your own than at other institutes if you're jonesing to work on the theory side or bail after the BS.  The comp sci department here is great, but the math department is downright terrible for undergrads.  I think also about 60-70% of the undergrads are pre-med, which comes with exactly the mentality you'd expect.</commentText><authorName>geodesic42</authorName><authorID>4xas9</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>3s7fro<comments><comment><commentCreated>1447477097.0</commentCreated><commentID>cwzalvx</commentID><commentText>That event makes me more worried about the state of mind that 19 year olds have, which is to censor everyone.

My issue is with the design of the statue because it looks pretty unprofessional. 

Edit: Also I know I'm being really picky, but it seems like no one at this school has taken the time to read the university logo's guidelines. That shield has a small version and a large version with some minor, yet somewhat important differences. [This](http://bwictu.jhu.edu/assets/websuite/shield_black.png) is the large shield, and [this](http://brand.jhu.edu/content/uploads/2014/06/university.shield.small_.blue_.png) is the small shield.

The way I describe Hopkins to people is that it's an intense place in a lot of senses, but in a good way! Whatever you do here (writing seminars, psych, compsci, BME, etc) is done with such positive intensity and passion. People here are all so passionate about what they do and it really makes for a special environment. This goes for everything, including political science.

My focus was in American politics, not IR or econ (which seemed to make me an outlier). The faculty is mostly good, with some stellar (Adam Sheingate is a fantastic professor and his Food Politics class is one of the most in-demand classes at Hopkins) and some bad. 

Even though the poli sci department is lower profile than others at JHU the JHU name will absolutely help you get internships. It is doable to intern in DC during the semester but to do 2 days a week, which is the minimum many places require, is a big commitment to pile on to classes and extracurriculars. 

The best part of majoring in poli sci is the amazing flexibility the department offers in terms of requirements. There are no required classes, just one class each in American, theory, IR and comparative, nine other poli sci classes, and 2 social science classes. Add in some summer classes and it is very feasible to graduate a semester early, as I did (while taking only 12 credits each of my last 3 semesters).

Happy to answer any other questions via PM.</commentText><authorName>ac91</authorName><authorID>658hi</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1445599126.0</commentCreated><commentID>cw9odrn</commentID><commentText>Engineering alum here, but I had plenty of friends in IR/poli sci.

If it's a different Griffiths, good luck with whatever test you choose and sorry I can't help. </commentText><authorName>maggiedo0dle</authorName><authorID>5dn2j</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>3ogw3f<comments /></submission><submission>3oggv5<comments><comment><commentCreated>1444774890.0</commentCreated><commentID>cvy51sc</commentID><commentText>To those of you saying "no really, they're ok". Here's a snippet of their website:

&gt;In addressing your illness or efforts to optimize wellness, your naturopathic care team might prescribe:

    Vitamin/mineral supplements
    Herbal remedies
    Homeopathic remedies
    Physical medicine
    Hydrotherapy treatments
    Diet and nutrition changes
    Exercise and other lifestyle changes
    Craniosacral therapy


If a website has homeopathy listed as a viable treatment for anything they are a sham at worst and unscientific at best, certainly not something an academic institution should be promoting.</commentText><authorName>trashacount12345</authorName><authorID>3w2ki</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1444699244.0</commentCreated><commentID>cvx3qkm</commentID><commentText>They're not directly promoting homeopathy. Bastyr is a Naturopath program. While this does include course work in homeopathy, it also focuses a tremendous amount of energy on positive living. If you take your average diabetic/obese/hypertensive American, they'd do a lot better under the supervision of a Naturopath than an MD in many cases. Don't discount it until you've researched it. But yeah, homeopathy is bullshit, but that's not the entirety of the focus of the program.</commentText><authorName>AdamJaz</authorName><authorID>3d6i6</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1444731655.0</commentCreated><commentID>cvxp7tx</commentID><commentText>I don't think it's so bad. I'm currently an MD/PhD student (read: pretty vested in the allopathic system) and we had a guy from bastyr come give a talk about some of the work he does and it was really interesting. They have a pretty different model for how treatments should look then we do, and as long as their clams are supported by evidence, I'm all for it. (And this guy, at least, was doing that.) We all have the same goal here.

I think the really big problem is that (IIRC) naturopaths are a licensed heath professional with boards and everything in Washington state, but not everywhere. So, in Missouri, any old asshole can call himself a naturopath. And that is definitely bullshit.</commentText><authorName>ASHoudini</authorName><authorID>5oyai</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>3obfcm<comments><comment><commentCreated>1444597306.0</commentCreated><commentID>cvvrapr</commentID><commentText>IB guy here applying to jhu.
IB is excellent way to prove to Universities that you are a capable student. Definitely take it and be aware that it is hard work. For jhu, if you get 6/7 in Hl's such as bio, chem, physics and maths, it allows you to skip introductory courses.

[Does this apply to you?](https://apply.jhu.edu/apply/faq/exchange-student/)

Otherwise, have you looked over [this](https://apply.jhu.edu/apply/faq/visiting-student/)? Your GPA means you have nothing to worry about it that area so what'll make you stand out from everyone else who applies with a great GPA will be great letters of recommendation so choose faculty who will sing your praises well. The app only requires a 250 word essay on "why Hopkins", which is basically only enough room to gush about how great you think the university is.  For the love of god, please don't write "because it's beautiful".  You know which other university is beautiful? Like 90% of all universities in the US are beautiful.  Be specific like "I'm a BME and Dr. X is a personal hero of mine because I used to not be able to cry and thanks to his revolutionary thingamagig I can cry now. Yay."

In general, when preparing an application, students are told to make it tell a story or to have an overarching theme. For you, given your TAship and tutoring, that's probably something to do with teaching so have your letter writers speak to that skill and then somehow find the room to talk about that in your little "essay", too. 

I haven't had coffee yet so hopefully this all makes sense. </commentText><authorName>nikhils_orange</authorName><authorID>5u97d</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>3l2l64<comments><comment><commentCreated>1442373046.0</commentCreated><commentID>cv2ndh7</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1442437221.0</commentCreated><commentID>cv3f71t</commentID><commentText>It depends which department you are doing it in and if you PI will go along with it.

Depending on your area of interest there might be good professors in the department.  A lot of the classes are taught by postdocs.  Downside is they get churned in and out every three years.

Most intro film courses

Most classes during the summer are easier because you are taking it with high school students 

Do not take history of science classes, from what I heard Hopkins really takes a lot of pride in those

Most classes will be easier if you know someone who has previously taken them

Usually the content is okay, but they will scramble the homework problems so you would need to copy the homework problems out of the library's reference copy.  If you spend a lot of time at the library this isn't a big deal.  

I personally think Stewart's Calculus book is very good.  It's very widely used among universities.  There are certainly more rigorous books out there, but for the general university student it does a good job.  Plus there are solutions manuals out there, which basically provide you an immense amount of worked out examples.

Clearly SAE was not doing its job checking college ids, or this would have never happened.

But suing the school? I seriously doubt that Hopkins can be successfully sued for something that happened at a property that it does not own or administer. I kind of feel like her lawyer made her sue the school as well since that's the only way he'd end up getting paid...

Let's think about it in another way. Technically the US government owns the land around the Grand Canyon (clearly the government has more culpability for what happens on this land than Hopkins did for the fraternity house). Suppose that someone was pushed off of the side by someone unaffiliated with the park. After surviving the fall and sustaining massive injuries, the victim sues both the assailant and the park (for negligence). I expect that everyone would agree that the victim here does not have a case against the park. Is it the park's responsibility to hire security for the entirety cliff? No. Is it the park's responsibility to install potentially destructive guard rails? No.

I don't see how we can hold Hopkins responsible when:

* They do not own or administer the land on which the event happened.
* The criminals and their victim are unaffiliated with the school.</commentText><authorName>MyTribeCalledQuest</authorName><authorID>4omi4</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1437730417.0</commentCreated><commentID>cte3019</commentID><commentText>http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/casesearch/processDisclaimer.jis

Upper level electives vary though. In humanities classes, a lot of the readings can be found online (check Wikisource or add "filetype:pdf" to your Google search).

Lend, eh...they'll sell them for a good price though.

I added CS back in sophomore year. I really like it-- I started taking a few CS classes because I was interested in programming and then decided to go ahead and add the major. 

Granted, I really like to program. If you like programming, you'll enjoy at least that aspect of the classes-- with the exception of the theory courses basically every class probably involves programming *somehow*.

I can't speak to internships/research because I do that sort of thing over in physics, or the CIS program, but:

The core curriculum is very small: there are only like five or six required courses, but you are required to take a *lot* (42 if doing the BS, 36 if doing the BA I think) CS credits to graduate. There are lots of electives, so you can basically take whatever you're interested in. This flexibility is really nice.

As /u/ModWilliam/ says, the new CS building (Malone Hall) is really nice and brand new. [Enrollment statistics](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/undergraduate-studies/program-tracks/) are here-- the program may be small but it's definitely been getting larger. The CS department recently hired a bunch of new faculty while expanding into their new building too.

The (first floor) ugrad lab is pretty nice-- I personally *don't* usually work there, unless I'm working with other people in a group or something. There's also the (third floor) ugrad lab, which is generally a lot emptier and maybe a better place to focus on getting work done? 

I'd also like to plug the [JHU ACM](https://www.acm.jhu.edu/)-- I'm biased, but despite the status of our website, we're a good resource and we have a largeish office on the ground floor of Malone that's a nice space to work or hang out in addition to the ugrad labs.

Hope some of that was useful. :)</commentText><authorName>TC01</authorName><authorID>8vr8k</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1435565879.0</commentCreated><commentID>cslw4b1</commentID><commentText>Current AMS/CS double major here (rising sophomore).

I've only taken two of the classes so far (Intermediate Programming and Automata &amp; Computation Theory), but as far as I can tell, the professors are passionate and are willing to help the students. 

&gt;Are the courses enjoyable (as far as college courses go)?

I took Intermediate Programming in my fall semester and it was quite a lot of work outside the classroom and the lectures weren't too interesting. I suspect that programming-heavy classes are all like this, since programming isn't something you can learn from a lecture - you have to do it in order to learn. That said, having covered grades made it less stressful.

Automata was a fun class for me. It's really different from what you'd normally expect in CS, since it's a lot of theory and minimal hands-on work. 

&gt; Has the curriculum been updated recently?

The curriculum really depends on the professors, and as far as the intro classes go, the basic ideas don't change much. The upper-level classes do keep up with the times, if that's what you're asking about.

&gt; Is the equipment in the computer lab up-to-date?

What equipment in particular, and what standards for up-to-date are you looking for?

As for the rest of the questions, hopefully someone else can chime in, since I'm not focused that much in CS as of yet. </commentText><authorName>integratedc</authorName><authorID>7h3nu</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1435563723.0</commentCreated><commentID>cslv3pg</commentID><commentText>The program is pretty small.

Although I realize I'm a STEM guy I think I might be able to give you some interesting perspective.

I really had no idea what I wanted to do when I came to JHU. I started out as an electrical engineer, but I wasn't all that into that. Within my first two weeks I switched to physics (technically you're undecided in freshman fall in the school of arts and sciences). I was amazed at how easy it was to switch majors. All I had to do was get a little form and speak to an adviser in the new department. During my sophomore year I got tired of physics and switched once again to mathematics with a second major in computer science, which was once again a very easy process. I wouldn't worry about being undecided, you can decide here if you want.

I think too often people peg us as a STEM school but I think that this is somewhat uninformed. We actually have the best writing seminars program, as well as the best school of education in the world. I have consistently heard from my friends that our history department is filled with fantastic professors. Personally, I really enjoyed the classes I took in the philosophy department. To top all of that off we have one of the best music conservatories in the world just two stops away on the JHMI (the school's shuttle).

I loved my time in Baltimore at JHU. I would have hated going to a place like Carnegie Mellon where you have to apply to a major and can't really switch later on (at least that was the policy when I was applying). The living's cheap, the character of the city is fantastic; it's a great place to put your foot down. I still have so many friends in the area and visit often.

I came in as a hard science major, then took some really awesome foreign language classes and social science classes like anthropology, and realized that what I wanted to study maybe wasn't biophysics like I'd intended. When switching majors to public health, I was surprised to find many of my previous classes had overlapped, even though the majors were so different. Here at Hopkins with our "distribution" requirements, you can really explore crazy different subjects to fulfill the requirements of any major. 

You'll have tons of freedom to decide what you like here. </commentText><authorName>Cncpcion</authorName><authorID>d4yzl</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1435358676.0</commentCreated><commentID>csjfm8p</commentID><commentText>I just graduated BME but I had friends from a lot of different majors and I myself am working in a field that's pretty unrelated to BME so I think I have a solid set of experiences to justify my views. My earnest opinion, especially if you're not sure what you want to do, would be to consider other schools of similar prestige to JHU. JHU is very academic focused in that it's great if you want to pursue grad school or be a doctor after college. But in terms of our other programs we don't stack up as well to your Harvards, Dukes, Northwesterns, etc. That's not to say that you can't be successful here, because you certainly can, but the overall major quality/name-brand/job-placement tends to be better at some other schools. As an example, I'm going into consulting and for this field JHU is not seen as a "target-school" in that they lump your application with those from "lesser" schools. They give preference to the schools I named above plus others and assume from the get-go that you won't be as impressive as someone from ivies or other schools. I know this is true for other industries too, such as banking, marketing, and (although to a lesser extent) engineering. It sounds harsh but the reality of the matter is that JHU, as much as I loved my experience here, leaves something to be desired in terms of industry relations, alumni network, and overall reputation. Again, I'd just like to reiterate that I'm not saying you won't get a job if you come here, I'm just saying it's going to be much harder for you than for an identical candidate from other schools for various reasons. The school has recently realized this and is trying to make changes to address it such as re-vamping the career center, but it is something you should consider when applying. I know you don't really have any idea what you want to do yet and I was just like you 5 years ago but the reality that I wish someone had told me is that the world is a harsh, competitive place and there are some schools that will prepare you for that better than others. 

With all that being said I found that JHU can be whatever you want it to be and it can certainly take you to whatever end-goal you want to get to. Just know in advance that you're going to have to work your ass off because it is a very rigorous school (as I'm sure everyone has already told you) but if you can find your passion and succeed here, there's really nothing else in life that you won't be able to accomplish because as I've heard from incredibly successful alumni from JHU, Hopkins was "the hardest thing they ever did;" harder than starting billion-dollar companies, or heading fortune 50 entities, etc. 

TLDR; if you're unsure of what you want to do you might want to consider other schools, Hopkins tends to be sink or swim. 

P.S. 95% of kids who go to top schools are just like you and have no idea what they really want to do. In your applications to these places you can either spin that to mean you want to find your passion at the school or write about maybe one subject you want to pursue there (you don't have to actually pursue it once you attend, it just gives you a basis for writing). </commentText><authorName>firesIncreaseDPS</authorName><authorID>7t1cn</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1435379164.0</commentCreated><commentID>csjt1dr</commentID><commentText>Definitely. I came in as Electrical Engineering and ended up switching to Applied Math with no issues. If you're coming in to the Krieger School (the school for humanities + natural science) I think you're technically a pre-major until sophomore year anyway unless you go out of your way to declare. It's honestly the same thing if you're applying to the engineering school except they make your declare immediately (whatever). 

I would recommend, if you think you're interested in the science side of things, take mostly relevant introductory classes (chem, calc 1, 2) your first semester and add a freshman seminar you find interesting. If you're interested more in the humanities side of things, take mostly humanities classes and add a science/math class. Those extraneous classes may help you find the right path for yourself. </commentText><authorName>StrangeShuckles</authorName><authorID>5jp0x</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1436140071.0</commentCreated><commentID>cssvy90</commentID><commentText>I'm a STEM guy, but I've taken a lot of French classes and Poetry classes.

As such it is essentially completely separate program from the standard, full-time graduate engineering programs. The courses are, for the most part, not offered at the main JHU campus and are taught by adjunct faculty of various stripes, not the tenure-track faculty.

That said, EP offers some very high-quality programs that are in fact highly valued by employers. (I can't speak to the quality of the CS program in particular.) You cannot transfer from EP programs to full-time programs; that requires re-applying.

EP students do have access to the library, including online journal subscriptions. I don't know about computing centers, but since those are mostly for research purposes I suspect not.  The EP web site says that EP students have access to the Career Center, but the link is broken. 

I am sure that if you simply contact EP they can answer all of these questions for you.</commentText><authorName>lazzarone</authorName><authorID>inkl2</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1431030790.0</commentCreated><commentID>cr1b5dz</commentID><commentText>The EP programs are more applied and less research-driven. That said, they aren't necessarily terminal degrees since you can likely go on to a a PhD if you so choose. Both programs are through Whiting and have courses on the main campus, though I think most courses in EP are at APL (could be wrong).

They're geared toward working engineers only, and as far as employers recognizing the degrees, I'd say yes, since it's often employers sending students there in the first place. As such, I don't know if career services are a big deal since all of the students are already working in industry - many for for area defense contractors, government, or aerospace, for example. If you're a working engineer, go for EP. If you want to or are able to fully concentrate on your masters and you're not yet in a career, go for the standard program.</commentText><authorName>wellthatdoesit</authorName><authorID>4p799</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1431041054.0</commentCreated><commentID>cr1ghwb</commentID><commentText>I did an MSECE through EP, so I took a handful of CS courses as electives, and I had a couple friends who did MSCS. The courses are still very challenging and high-quality; you'll definitely get a good education if you put the work in. Most of the courses are at APL, a few are at other locations, and some are online. You definitely have full access to Sheridan.

I don't know about the career services or computing centers thing; I actually did all but one class online since I took a job across the country after my first semester. That said, there were enough online classes, and excellent support, that I was able to finish in the standard two years without trouble. That was also before they completely supported finishing your degree online, which was neat. It's been three years since I graduated, and they were talking about making it a full option, so I'm sure by now the support has gotten even better.

As far as employers respecting it, there's zero appreciable difference in the diploma you get and no mention is made of it on any official documents. The only way employers will know the difference is if you tell them, and frankly, I think they'd have just as much or more respect for someone who can juggle a full-time job and a masters program. As someone already noted, the idea of this program is that you already have a job and your employer is sponsoring you to go, so career services are a little less important.</commentText><authorName>Lvl9LightSpell</authorName><authorID>3n21r</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1432472211.0</commentCreated><commentID>crj2y7k</commentID><commentText>Does anyone know about the format of the online courses?

First, you could buy a house in baltimore and be a commuting resident. Therefore you wouldn't have to pay room or board but only for your house and food. It's a good deal of paperwork but you will save a lot of money because dorming is way more expensive. 

Think of it as a long term investment. Hopkins is growing and getting better every day so after your 4/5 years here are done you can just rent out that house to future students. 

You lose the social aspect of the dorms though. Living in dorms was fantastic because you're always in close proximity of most of your friends and most buildings on campus

Work study will net you probably half of board or so. 

I wouldn't worry too much about loans, you should be able to get a $70-75k a year job right out of school depending on your major.

When I first started I wanted to double in Behavioral Bio and ChemBe and they told me no.  They also told me you can't double major across schools, ie engineering and arts and sciences, and that's bullshit.  Looking back I probably could have double majored in Behavioral Bio and ChemBe if I would have pushed back harder.

I ended up double majoring in ChemBe and Math, and then I got my masters in Math in my 4th year.  Yes, it is doable.  No, it is not easy.  I took more than 20 credits for many semesters.  I think the most I took was 23 in a single semester.  You have to do a lot of bargaining with advisers at first to let you take that many classes.  If you can maintain the grades, they will let to exceed the credit limit by more and more.  

I definitely don't regret it because I got my job because of my second major.  Even so, with that being said it's a ton of work.  I didn't declare my second major until 1st semester junior year, so you have lots of time to ease into it and see if it's feasible.

Edit:  I just want to add that ChemBe is really hard, especially sophomore year.  You will spend an *incredible* amount of time doing problem sets and studying.  It's a lot of work, don't underestimate it.  Don't double major because you think it looks good or makes you a stronger candidate for grad school or jobs.  If you truly are interested in materials, why not look for a lab position within a materials science group?  Maybe take a few electives in materials.  </commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1430973359.0</commentCreated><commentID>cr0mxjl</commentID><commentText>Graduating Mech E. here!

Usually undergrads take two of those a semester, leaving plenty of room for electives and other graduation requirements. Who are the professors for the classes? Joanne Selinski was supposedly easier, but I think that's because she gives you exact requirements down to the point value a single multiple choice question will have on your final grade.

Personally I'd suggest sticking to two programming classes a semester, but that's because I was also interested in a lot of other electives. I took a bunch of Japanese (language not required for bs when I was there), history, and earth sciences, which were pretty time intensive classes. If you're only interested in cs, take all three. A driven student can certainly do it. I took three upperclassmen classes as a first semester senior and did fine. 

Tl;dr you can do it, but I'd suggest more electives since it's so early in your degree.

When you read your articles, check your sources and make sure you double check them. /r/baltimore has a good article about describing how [City Paper](http://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/345sfc/the_corruption_of_city_paper_baltimore/) went out of its way to depict the altercation between the woman with her bag and a man trying to grab it.

We had several days of peaceful protests for a good cause. It's unclear and I think unlikely that those who were violent in the last few days are the same people who were protesting and who care about the cause. 

From watching local media (mainly WBALTV11) it appears that police have been behaving pretty well and professional and it is sad to see violence destroying this city. I'm especially convinced that some of these individuals have complete disregard for the original cause with all the assaults on the BCFD trying to put out fires and save lives. ([LINK](https://vine.co/v/eWUr9wQAEMr)) Not to mention the destruction of the new senior center. I have however seen a couple videos of a police officer throwing rocks at protesters ([LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSmWuCx_VII), [LINK]()). I've also seen accounts that non-protestors, including white people, at Camden Yards on Saturday were provoking the violence. ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/cW2UMCo.jpg)) I've also seen plenty of videos of protesters, religious groups, and civilians trying to stop the violence and calm the aggressive groups. ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/So98Avy.jpg), [LINK](https://twitter.com/ACFromDaBranch/status/592839101574946817)) The majority of Baltimore is not being aggressive and violent, and most want peace in their own neighborhoods. ([LINK](http://mic.com/articles/116702/10-images-of-the-baltimore-riots-you-won-t-be-seeing-on-tv))

I've also seen quite a few arguments on social media defending the use for violence and destruction. It sounds like the gist is that peaceful protests aren't enough, and the only way to get a voice heard is with violent action in a dire situation. I'm not sure how to feel about this, but I personally still think the destruction of the city buildings, arson, looting, and damaging and destroying civilian and police cars is causing more harm than good. I'm open for discussion here. 

Finally, I'm curious how the Hopkins "Bubble" community feels. Yik Yak obviously has a lot of trolls being racist due to the anonymity, but it's possible that some of those are actual opinions of people. And there's immature joking about The Wire references. I don't condemn racism of course, but how does the JHU community actually feel about this, especially with many being outsiders of Baltimore? One facebook post of note ([LINK](https://i.imgur.com/IT48SO2.png)) brings up the argument that JHU affiliates have no right to advocate peace in this situation. I personally can't understand this argument, since it seems hypocritical to argue that the violence IS the right thing to do when you're in the same situation. I'm open to counterargument. 

I'm really curious to have a discussion why some believe the violence is justified. Peaceful protests aren't easy but they've been very successful and foster much more respect in the past, and that was the original intention of the protesters. </commentText><authorName>Sgt_Ice_Bucket</authorName><authorID>4tg7p</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1430301810.0</commentCreated><commentID>cqs6crj</commentID><commentText>Hello JHU!

Checking in from UCLA. I have friends going to JHU so I've been keeping a particular eye out on the matter. 

Seeing the downtown area getting messed up and all the chaos breaking out is quite disturbing and horrifying, with the thought that this could have happened everywhere. LA is not a place with no racial tension, in fact we're still recovering from the 1992 race riot. All kinds of protests are breaking out here also, downtown, south LA, and even UCLA campus. In fact, a couple of weeks ago a protest lead to students getting arrested for blocking freeway off-ramps.

I guess what I want to say is, safety is above everything. Of course if you have opinions and frustrations, you deserve to talk and get heard, but don't put yourself in jeopardy by doing so.

While I personally can't attest to the APL connection, there is a separate program for JHU students to get internships with APL. Being interested in aerospace sets you apart from most people at Hopkins, so that's probably an advantage there. I don't have any specific numbers though as to how many students are accepted each year. There are plenty of other opportunities available for aerospace internships outside of the Hopkins umbrella. APL isn't your only option. 

The concentration itself is pretty easy to get. 5 classes from the aerospace offerings, which you won't start until your junior year anyway. It's not something you really have to plan for, since you have to take Mechanical Engineering and Technical electives and all of your aerospace classes will fall into those two categories. If you're interested in more of the space side of things there is a minor in Space Science and Engineering. I'm solidly an aeronautics person so I don't know too much about it, but you can look it up if that interests you.</commentText><authorName>ameriswissy</authorName><authorID>6sqcp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1430256101.0</commentCreated><commentID>cqreca4</commentID><commentText>My advice to you would be to take as many courses as you can with Prof. Joseph Katz.

1) The two extra courses is almost certainly way easier than the thesis

2) The classes are really easy or really hard depending on what you take. I did more of a solid mechanics curriculum, ended up taking like one class actually in the MechE dept., and had a great time.  If you do graduate Fluids with Prosperetti you're gonna have a bad time.

3) Don't take online classes if you can avoid it, it's a lot easier to fall behind/get trapped in the "do no work" loop.

4) I took a class at APL, it's not a big deal to get there (like a 30-40 minute drive), and it was an excellent class.  Usually they're a three hour class once a week (I think mine was 6 to 9) so the commuting's not bad if you're only taking one.

5) Again depending on which classes you end up taking you're going to be in classes anywhere from like 5 to 50+ people.  The classes everyone takes like PDE and FEA are pretty crowded but I took a solid mechanics class through CivE that had about 8 people in it (mostly because their department is tiny).  

If you want a brief description of the classes/profs I took I can do that, but like I said I went more the solid mechanics/properties of materials than the fluids side.</commentText><authorName>Coomb</authorName><authorID>e5wwg</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>33al78<comments><comment><commentCreated>1429607164.0</commentCreated><commentID>cqj56ra</commentID><commentText>What's wrong with the beach?</commentText><authorName>bobtheterminator</authorName><authorID>6jypy</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1429609508.0</commentCreated><commentID>cqj6mn4</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1429611250.0</commentCreated><commentID>cqj7ob4</commentID><commentText>I'd suggest one of the quieter quads like Decker.</commentText><authorName>vcelloho</authorName><authorID>d3e9z</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1429753004.0</commentCreated><commentID>cql0qsz</commentID><commentText>You can get on the roof of a lot of buildings.</commentText><authorName>gogogadgt</authorName><authorID>dk5tr</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>339ewj<comments><comment><commentCreated>1429593976.0</commentCreated><commentID>cqixhxz</commentID><commentText>Has anyone ever tried the barbecue truck?

To switch into BME you can apply to the department at the end of your first semester.  I would contact someone from BME now and tell them your situation and see what they say. Couldn't hurt and it'll get you at least a little bit in the door with them. Everyone I know who has successfully switched into BME had really good grades their first semester.  It's hard to switch into it, from what I've heard.

To switch into any other engineering major (or any major in art and sciences, too), you just need to fill out a form and get the appropriate signatures.  </commentText><authorName>nikhils_orange</authorName><authorID>5u97d</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>32utln<comments /></submission><submission>32twb9<comments /></submission><submission>32ql78<comments><comment><commentCreated>1429229902.0</commentCreated><commentID>cqeg4jw</commentID><commentText>The mental notes are great.

Seems BS that the Newsletter can publish that using hundreds of dollars for printing thousands of copies yet other candidates can only use $50 (http://sga.jhu.edu/branches/cse/election-documents/) and have to address potential voters by name. Also if Bartholet was not on the Newsletter it's almost certain he wouldn't have been written about in that way considering the authors acknowledge their personal relationship with him is the basis of their judgement: 

*"In reflecting on our personal experiences with both Bartholet and with Jason Plush, who is a former Sports Editor of the newspaper, we believe that we have been able to make better-informed judgments."*

I think Zappone should be dq'ed for her obvious infraction but Bartholet's connection with the Newsletter does seem unfair considering the scope of its reach when compared to the campaign rules binding the other candidates. </commentText><authorName>gogogadgt</authorName><authorID>dk5tr</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>31hb81<comments><comment><commentCreated>1428230121.0</commentCreated><commentID>cq1kiin</commentID><commentText>In general, they are only _slightly_ less work in total than normal classes... which means they're extremely condensed and it can be quite difficult to manage unless you work harder than usual.

Dear Member of the Johns Hopkins Community,

More than 60 years ago, the U.S. government conducted an unconscionable and unethical experiment in Guatemala, in which U.S. government researchers deliberately infected vulnerable citizens of Guatemala with syphilis and other infectious diseases. We feel profound sympathy for the individuals and families impacted by this deplorable study.

When the details of this study came to light, a Presidential Commission determined that the Guatemala Study was funded and conducted by the United States Government. In 2010, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and Human Services apologized to all affected. In 2012, a federal district court concluded that the pleas of victims for relief are more appropriately directed to the political branches of the federal government.

Today, attorneys representing Guatemalan plaintiffs announced that they are suing The Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System, alleging that Johns Hopkins was responsible for the study. The plaintiffs&#8217; essential claim in this case is that prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members&#8217; participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself, and therefore that Johns Hopkins should be held liable. 

Neither assertion is true.

This was not a Johns Hopkins study. Johns Hopkins did not initiate, pay for, direct or conduct the study in Guatemala. Participation in the review of government research was then and is today separate from being a Johns Hopkins employee, and no nonprofit university or hospital has ever been held liable for a study conducted by the U.S. Government. 

As a leading global research university, Johns Hopkins values rigorous and open scrutiny of history, even when it is complex and uncomfortable.

We know that historians have previously linked prominent Johns Hopkins faculty members in various ways to other unethical government research studies in Tuskegee and Terre Haute. Although separate from the Guatemala lawsuit, these studies were all deplorable and all demand reflection upon the broader legacy of unethical research. It is important to confront and learn from the past.  At the same time, we cannot let unfounded allegations go unchallenged. We will defend the institution vigorously in court against legal responsibility for the government&#8217;s Guatemala study.
 
If you would like more information about the university&#8217;s position on the lawsuit, we have released a media statement that you can find [here](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/guatemala_study/index.html), along with information about the Presidential Commission on the research in Guatemala and its findings.

Sincerely,
Ronald J. Daniels             
President, The Johns Hopkins University                              
               
Paul B. Rothman, M.D.
Dean of the Medical Faculty
CEO, Johns Hopkins Medicine
 
Michael J. Klag, M.D., M.P.H.
Dean, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health

Seems like the only connection is some Hopkins faculty members served on the committee that approved funding for this study. Which is shitty of them, but there's no reason the University should be held accountable.</commentText><authorName>bobtheterminator</authorName><authorID>6jypy</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1427991796.0</commentCreated><commentID>cpyp9pz</commentID><commentText>**Here is all Dr. Cutler research records digitized online**

If you want to stay up here, in Charles village, there are usually plenty of furnished places that people would sublet to you. The prices in the summer usually are lower than that of the school year. So don't settle for the first place you find. Obviously row houses would be cheaper but may have rowdier roommates. Since you are working downtown, fells point, the inner harbor, canton, and fed hill will likely have nicer places to live if you can secure a short term lease. I would check craigslist to see if there are any places in those areas you can sublet from a med student. Even mount Vernon could cut your commute and have you live in nicer accommodations for a similar price.

Baltimore in general isn't too dangerous. Just use common sense and try not to walk long distances alone at night. Price range at Jhu can vary from approximately 600-1000$ a month depending on what sort of place you are living in. As I said before, prices drop a little in the summer since there are usually a plethora of places to sublet</commentText><authorName>rebel4</authorName><authorID>a0v70</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1428028317.0</commentCreated><commentID>cpz4c5y</commentID><commentText>Yo! I'm a mica student living in baltimore and I am trying to sublet my room in bolton hill for 600/month from june 1 to mid august. Very safe area. pm me if you are interested in more info. My place is a bit closer to downtown than hopkins is.</commentText><authorName>baltjos</authorName><authorID>mnsf4</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1427977721.0</commentCreated><commentID>cpyl6lr</commentID><commentText>You asked a few questions

1. People generally post their subletting ads in a Hopkins facebook group but you need a .jhu email address to join. I know of a few people subletting and one of them actually lives in a pretty nice/cheap house that's completely safe and central to everything around campus.

2. Tons of people sublet in the summer. Anyone who is not taking classes or doing research at the med campus is probably doing something not in Baltimore so all these people are trying to get rooms off of their hands for the summer.

3. Prices can range depending on where you're staying but I'd say expect to be paying anywhere from $600 - $900 a month total for rent and utilities. Of course it can get lower or higher depending on the luxury/safety you're looking for.

4. People give Baltimore a lot of crap for being unsafe and rightfully so, to a degree. There are many parts of Baltimore that you do not want to be in by yourself, even in the middle of the day. Fortunately, these places are pretty far from campus so you should be fine. Although, there are a lot of robberies/assaults at night if you go lower than 30th street or higher than guilford (so abell, greenmount, etc. as a general rule of thumb you do not want to be past greenmount at night). Anywhere on the north side of campus is really safe, this is where rich people/families live. But, in general, JHU puts security on just about every block within a 3-4 block radius 24/7, so things are pretty safe and there is a night shuttle that will take you point to point at night if you are uncomfortable walking. 

PM me if you have any more questions or you'd like me to put you in touch with the person I know that is subletting.

EDIT: So I just read /u/rebel4's post and I totally agree with him that commuting here to downtown could be bad if you do not have your own car. Also, I don't know your age but if you are 21 (or very easily can be), I would recommend living in fed hill/fell's/mt. vernon point because they have a younger crowd compared to some parts of the city and a WAY better nightlife than around Charles Village. The nightlife here in the summer really sucks, it's a lot of house parties which would be tough to find if you're not from here or know somebody. Living in a place like fed hill will put you in the middle of a lot of people in their early-to-mid 20's who like to have a good time and there's plenty of bars/restaurants to do it at. Also, the commute would be a lot better.</commentText><authorName>firesIncreaseDPS</authorName><authorID>7t1cn</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>3147yz<comments /></submission><submission>30yjyh<comments><comment><commentCreated>1427869349.0</commentCreated><commentID>cpx63gs</commentID><commentText>It's a different kind of approach than the biochem in the biology department.  Is Pat Fleming teaching it?  He's incredible but demanding.  The tests are hard and are more about taking the logic of what you've learned and applying it to new situations.  It's been a while and they've just it a lot since I took it but it was worth it.  My friends in the regular biochem just seemed to be memorizing things. My experience as a biophysics major was extremely positive and I'd encourage you to take a class in the department.  The class size will be very small, unlike the 250+ you'll have in regular biochem.  The professors will be extremely approachable.  The other students in the major/classes all work together on problem sets in Jenkins 122 (that's the computer lab) and the stuff you learn goes beyond and actually talks about the whys and hows.  It's a great department.  I can't say enough good things about it.  10/10 would recommend.

As for your other concerns: who's teaching p-chem?  P-chem was not that hard when I took it but I had an older professor who just lectured from the book and wasn't really creative with his tests or problem sets.  I never took p-chem lab so I can't comment on that but I've heard it's pretty time consuming.  Biophysics biochem will also be time consuming.</commentText><authorName>nikhils_orange</authorName><authorID>5u97d</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>30uv0t<comments /></submission><submission>30ggoa<comments><comment><commentCreated>1427458250.0</commentCreated><commentID>cps7o91</commentID><commentText>You can definitely sit in on classes- you just have to find them.

APL Mission Statement: "The core purpose of APL is to enhance the security of the nation through transformative innovation in, and application of, science and technology."

APL's goal is national security. The US justifies civilian spying by claiming it's for national security. Most of APL's work is sponsored by the US Government. 

If you're mad about this, don't protest APL, protest the government. </commentText><authorName>grex1</authorName><authorID>5b3uy</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1426257287.0</commentCreated><commentID>cpdfz5c</commentID><commentText>no shit, sherlock</commentText><authorName>StrangeShuckles</authorName><authorID>5jp0x</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>2yitky<comments><comment><commentCreated>1426044138.0</commentCreated><commentID>cpakc57</commentID><commentText>Its cool...

Hopkins alumni here. I got my degrees a little over a year ago and I'm a car enthusiast, but like you, never really got anything going at Hopkins.

I'm a prelude guy, so if you got any questions about preludes (mostly 4th and 5th gen, a little bit on 3rd), ask away. Good to meet you Thom.

Some places will do it super early (January), others will do it right at the beginning of rush. It's not weird to keep going if you haven't gotten anything yet. It is weird if you end up never knowing any of the brothers no matter how many times you go, though...

b) Not weird at all, just means you'll have to make an extra effort to "get noticed" so-to-speak.

c) Yeah most kids will get bids to at least 1 house.

d) I'd say this depends. If you had your heart set on going to this house and went to all their rush events and they told you they weren't going to give you a bid (which happens btw), then that would definitely be weird for both parties going back. Otherwise, it's probably chill to stop by for a large gathering like a party. Maybe not the smaller stuff, though.

e) Just get to know the brothers beforehand, if you haven't already figured out from first semester what houses suit you then you really need to figure this out during intersession. They all have different personalities and take different kinds of people. Visit a bunch of houses both now and during rush if you need to. Also, if you do rush right, you can think of rushing and pledging each as 4 more credit hours on your schedule.

All that being said have fun, the rush period is a pretty fun time complete with tons of free stuff and cool events.</commentText><authorName>firesIncreaseDPS</authorName><authorID>7t1cn</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1421063561.0</commentCreated><commentID>cnm5vid</commentID><commentText>1) Some people do, some people don't -- but it depends on the fraternity. It's only weird if someone has told you that you definitively won't be getting a bid, since the entire point of rush is to see what fraternity is a good fit for you. 

2) Not at all! That's what rush is for. 

3) I don't know the stats, but it largely depends on which house you're looking to join. 

4) It definitely depends on the fraternity. Some places will have open parties that literally anyone at Hopkins is invited to, and others won't. This also depends on how you didn't receive a bid: If you were told that you weren't a good fit, then you and the fraternity brothers might feel awkward if you show up. If there are enough people at the house that like you, then you could probably still hang out. 

5) Meet everyone possible. Be out going, even if it's a bit uncomfortable, because that's how you'll make connections and have the best shot at joining. The rush commitment isn't that big since there are a few events during the week, but pledging is an enormous time commitment. Most fraternities insist that you prioritize school work and your health before any pledging activity, but I'd say pledging becomes the dominant focus of your life. Which isn't a bad thing: you'll form tight bonds with your pledge class and the older brothers you meet.

Its not weird to go to an event if you don't know anyone, just be willing to talk about yourself.

Unless you are incredibly awkward you'll get a bid somewhere. I honestly wouldn't worry about it and just enjoy your time.

For the larger fraternities they probably won't even notice and for the smaller ones no one is going to bar you from the house unless you cause issues.

For rush, just be yourself and make sure you talk to as many brothers as possible at each house.  You need to make sure its a good fit for you and that they notice you to get a bid.  

Pledging is a serious time commitment.  If you're not willing to put in the time it won't be very fun and you won't get a lot out of it.  I have a few dozen best friends for life from my fraternity and the connections i've made in the professional world have been invaluable.

I got in a year ago and it seems like yesterday. Enjoy your last semester of high school as much as possible because your grades really don't matter (just don't really fuck up). Since you applied early you probably already like Hopkins, but if you're like I was, there are still a lot of unanswered questions and big question marks about the Hopkins experience.

When regular decision stuff comes out you'll start to get access to myJHU, your email, and all the fun forms. You'll get to pick your classes over the summer (at 7am EST or 4 am for West Coasters like me), which is super exciting, but also very stressful because you might not get all the classes you want to take. Finally, you will come to Baltimore a little nervous, but very excited to meet everyone and start school. 

Orientation is incredibly fun. The required stuff is meh, but it's basically a week of getting to know awesome people and partying most nights if that's what you're into. Try to meet as many people as possible and get a doorstop so people can stick their heads in and say hi (I live in AMR II and it's awesome). One thing I was worried about was safety in the surrounding neighborhood, but I always feel safe while walking around, even when walking to parties at night. Reply if you want more info on the party scene, but I'm not going to go in depth right now because I don't know if you're interested. 

Campus is awesome and there are lot's of great things for you to explore once you get here. It might seem impossible to know where to go, but after a bit of time you will have a general idea of where all the buildings are and what is in them. The best advice I can give you is to find your favorite study space on campus because there are lots of good options. I love the reading room in Brody because it's quiet and awesome, but people like studying in the library or in the rest of Brody. The Gilman reading room is also awesome if you want to get a lot of work done. Your dorm will have places to study too, and your room is always a good option if you can actually get work done. 

Baltimore has its ups and downs. I came in with really low expectations so I was really surprised by what Baltimore has to offer. Hampden, the neighborhood to the west of campus, is nice and has good food. It's easy to get around with busses or uber, so going downtown is really fun. You should go to Fells Point with your parents because it is an awesome neighborhood on the water and has lots of good food places. The harbor is nice and has great food, the aquarium, and some places for downtown parties. Orioles games are super fun and pretty cheap. That being said, Baltimore is pretty sketchy and you don't have the freedom to just wander like you can in other places. There are very specific boundaries to where you should go in the area around campus. 

I took a really easy schedule for the first semester and loved every second of it. The first semester is a time to make and solidify friendships so it's good to not be super stressed about classes at the same time. You could also take advantage of covered grades and take a hard course load to get stuff out of the way while grades don't matter. I loved all my classes, but definitely check the old course evaluations for reviews of the classes you sign up for (google jhu course evaluations). 

Congrats again! You'll be on campus before you know it and I hope you love it as much as I love it. </commentText><authorName>hongkongdryclean</authorName><authorID>54pqo</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1418647070.0</commentCreated><commentID>cmv8ey9</commentID><commentText>You're getting some great advice in this thread. One thing I would add: Don't be afraid of Baltimore.

I'll say it again.

Don't be afraid of Baltimore. Don't be afraid of Baltimore. **Don't be afraid of Baltimore.**

Unless Hopkins orientation has changed a lot since I was a freshman, a lot of time will be spent on security walks and seminars that will tell you terrible things about the area. Yes, there is crime here, like in any city, but but there are fantastic people and incredible things to see in places you wouldn't otherwise go. People have mentioned Fells Point and Hampden, but I'd also like to recommend you check out the Mount Vernon area, Canton, and Druid Hill Park.

Mount Vernon: Location of Peabody, our sister music conservatory. If you like music at all you can take classes there for (I believe) no extra cost. It's also a designated art neighborhood. Hopkins has a pretty crazy independent music/theater/art scene, and a lot of it is centered there. Hotspots:

* [Center Stage](http://www.centerstage.org/)- Largest regional Theater in Baltimore
* [The Copycat](http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/79#.VI5bCCvF_Xs)- Co-op/commune/venue for performing artists of all kinds. Lots of cool shows/bands happen here. [Schedule &amp; info](https://www.facebook.com/pages/THE-COPYCAT-THEATRE/210387653808)
* [Fifth Dimension](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-5th-Dimension/353046121374434)- The 5th floor of the H&amp;H building. Mostly awesome weird shit happens here. They tend to throw good holiday parties as well, if you every get tired of the Hopkins party scene.

Druid Hill Park- Just a really nice park.

Other fun stuff-

* [The Baltimore Rock Opera Society](http://baltimorerockopera.org/). Take a cool date here.
* [ShowSpace](http://showspace.tumblr.com/) List of cool shows and events in Baltimore.
* [Single Carrot](http://singlecarrot.com/) Other regional theater. Not as weird or "arty" as some previous suggestions.




This isn't something you need to think too much about at first. I honestly would recommend spending your first semester checking out all the cool stuff campus/your dorm has to offer and not worrying at all about exploring outside the local neighborhood. But save this post for when you start to get bored of campus. There's a Hopkins bubble too many people get trapped in, and you miss out on a lot of opportunities.

----

Also, good freshman hack. If you meet friends that aren't signed up for Uber or Lyft, get them to sign up using your invite code. Every time someone you referred pays for their first ride, you $20 off your next ride. (Essentially a free trip.)

Also, join /r/Baltimore.</commentText><authorName>Yawehg</authorName><authorID>6nksr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1418565075.0</commentCreated><commentID>cmucaev</commentID><commentText>This stuff is pretty good: http://www.reddit.com/r/jhu/comments/yd6u9/any_advice_on_college_life_and_habits_i_should/</commentText><authorName>irritatedcitydweller</authorName><authorID>gbfws</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1418626271.0</commentCreated><commentID>cmuxet2</commentID><commentText>Congrats! In addition to what's already been written, go on Pre-O!!!! If you're not familiar with this, it's basically a week in the wilderness with a small group of fellow freshmen and 3-4 upperclass leaders. It takes place in the week before Orientation, so you won't miss out on anything.

There are trips in Appalachian backpacking, whitewater kayaking, sea kayaking, climbing, and canoeing. And if you can't decide on just one, there's a multi Pre-O that includes all of these. Obviously, I highly recommend the climbing trip, since I went on that one :) You get to know some really cool people, make some pretty damn good food together, and have a fun week in the wild! Plus once you get back to campus, you already have a group of friends you can hang out with!

I double majored in ChemBe and BA/MA in Math.  At first I just focused on ChemBe and took a few upper level math electives.  I declared my math major in my junior year.  It was a bit of work, and I took something like five 400/600 level math classes my senior year.  

If you are really interested in doing something like biostatistics, or computational biology work I would say choose AMS as your main and then start tacking on electives in Public Health.  In terms of post graduation employment, you will be certainly better off with a degree in AMS than Public Health (no offense to Public Health folks.)  It's just a very applicable degree that is diverse and opens up a lot of job opportunities, and employers will hire simply because you can do math.  After a semester or two, if you feel like you can handle the workload declare the 2nd major.  </commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1417772328.0</commentCreated><commentID>cmljug8</commentID><commentText>I know several people who have doubled with "weird" majors, ie.

A lot of what you pay in tuition is need-based, so while your sister was in school, your parents were on the hook for less at Hopkins as a reflection of what the school perceived them to be able to afford. 

She graduates, now that chunk of money going to her is freed up, so JHU calculates that they can now afford much more for your education. 

Same thing happened to me after my freshman year undergrad at loyola when my sister finished NYU. 

Whether or not you feel this is fair or wish to transfer is your business. But I would assume your parents probably knew this was likely to happen and planned for it. </commentText><authorName>Burnsiah</authorName><authorID>53r2x</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1417005176.0</commentCreated><commentID>cmdb258</commentID><commentText>As someone who's transferred a few times, DON'T.  Requirements are particular for each institution and you could wind up having to make up sequential prereqs before getting to the courses you truly need.  Things worked out for me, but it was much more difficult because of it.  Not to mention, as a parent, my #1 concern would be seeing you through to your degree.  You could easily wind up paying $15k/year at a public university, and cost of living expenses can't be neglected, either.  If you transferred and lost a semester or two, the difference in money becomes a non-factor(might even be more expensive if you have to do another year of living expenses), and you lose out on the Forever Achievement of your Hopkins degree.  

Stay here.  Seriously.  Also, sharpen up your cost/benefit analysis before you cut me open, this one is pretty cut and dry.  ;-)</commentText><authorName>PhononMagnon</authorName><authorID>6j9sd</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1416965901.0</commentCreated><commentID>cmcqv86</commentID><commentText>This situation all around sucks, but are you sure the new school allows you to transfer for just your final year?

There's a lot of work but all the classes I'm taking are great. As an economics major I have a lot of freedom to take any class that interests me which is awesome. There aren't any classes that Hopkins makes you take, you just have to end up with a certain amount of humanities, science, engineering, and math classes to graduate. I found this particularly awesome because I hate language and I never have to take language, but it's also great because it gives you the freedom to take whatever you want.

On the social life side of Hopkins, there are tons of awesome things to do around campus and in Baltimore so I never get bored. There are great clubs to join and I guarantee you will find way too many that sound appealing at the clubs fair. One of my favorite things Hopkins does is bring in awesome speakers in something called the [MSE Symposium](http://web.jhu.edu/msesymposium/about/index.html). If you click there you can see who they've brought in over the years. You can find parties at frats and other houses on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays and these are all pretty fun. Fraternities and sororities have rush in the Spring so you don't have to decide until the second semester. If you get sick of the house party scene you can go downtown to some of the clubs and that's also a good time. I went to an Orioles game and my roommate went to a Ravens game so that's also something fun about Baltimore. The Orioles games are cheap for college students on certain nights, but normal tickets are cheap enough too. The aquarium in Baltimore has discount days to make it cheap and it's worth seeing. The food in Baltimore is amazing and there are some really cool, safe neighborhoods (Fells Point, Inner Harbor, Federal Hill, Mt. Vernon, Hampden). It's pretty easy to get around if you're willing to take busses or spend some money on Uber (it's only around $2-3 to go downtown if you split the fare with your friends). The food at Hopkins is really good (ranked second in the nation), but it's nice to go out with friends to change things up a bit. 

Overall, Hopkins is a lot of work, but the friends you will meet and the fun you will have makes it worth it.

The tunnel system stretches all the way up to the athletic center and to the buildings around the gilman quad, if you go north on T2, but I never got around to drawing that part of the map before I graduated.

No pictures, unfortunately; this was long before digital cameras were in everyone's pocket.

If you think planes and space are cool, you should take this class.

There's also another one that is a history of music, where the classes basically consist of listening to songs and talking about them.  The instructor is a classical composer and, again, really knows his stuff...but it's an intersession course so you don't need to do much in order to pass.  I really enjoyed this class because I love listening to music, and I got introduced into a bunch of good stuff.

Yes, the administration fucked up massively and should be held accountable. At the very least, Dean Boswell should be made to resign. However, it doesn't follow that banning frat parties is a way of dodging that accountability. ~~Every reported sexual assault at Hopkins in the past few years has taken place at frat parties. It isn't as if frats are the only places Hopkins students party. Therefore, one draws the conclusion that there's something particular about frat parties that is conducive to sexual assault, something that seems not to be replicated in other settings.~~ EDIT: I was incorrect about this, see my response to kittycatcate for more info. I believe that most of the rest of my argument stands.

While the article isn't exactly clear on what the university *should* do rather than banning frat parties, it seems like there are two solutions. 

One, which I wholeheartedly agree with, is that the university should reform its manner of dealing with victims of sexual assault. The administration's behavior truly has been unacceptable and shameful. 

Two - and here is the real failure of reasoning in the article - is the metaphor of taking the booze away from the alcoholic. It's not frat parties, the author says, but rape culture. Well, okay. There's some truth to that. But as a demand for action by the administration, it's totally incoherent. The implicit demand is that rather than treating the symptom - sexual assault which has been happening ~~exclusively~~ at frat parties - the administration should alter the values and belief systems of all students and non-affiliates involved in sexual violence. First, there's no clear argument put forward as to why they shouldn't treat the symptom *and* attempt to address the root cause. Second, it places an unrealistically large burden on the administration for a problem that demands immediate action. It isn't as if the administration has been capable of eliminating rape culture but is holding off for self-serving reasons.

This article is self-deluded or dishonest. There may be real arguments to be made for allowing frat parties, but they aren't to be found here. I doubt anyone seriously believes that banning frat parties will solve the problems of sexual violence of Hopkins, but as a triage measure it seems like an appropriate course of action.</commentText><authorName>mybaltimoreaccount</authorName><authorID>7f3xh</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1415811251.0</commentCreated><commentID>cm08jhg</commentID><commentText>So more or less [this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PYb_anBMus) Everything is apart of something bigger so don't punish anyone unless everything ever is held responsible.</commentText><authorName>Otter__Stratton</authorName><authorID>jbl5w</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>2lvdwt<comments><comment><commentCreated>1415667947.0</commentCreated><commentID>clyidx6</commentID><commentText>Is this a joke?</commentText><authorName>grizz281</authorName><authorID>59mb6</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1415666753.0</commentCreated><commentID>clyhr6j</commentID><commentText>[Source](https://www.facebook.com/jhusnaps/photos/a.851070288243814.1073741829.847300505287459/1011303235553851/)</commentText><authorName>Sgt_Ice_Bucket</authorName><authorID>4tg7p</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1415708683.0</commentCreated><commentID>clz42xx</commentID><commentText>I imagine the guy who wrote this is the type of person who'd quote the "First they came for the socialists" Holocaust poem in an attempt to defend frat parties.</commentText><authorName>aWickedGangAreWe</authorName><authorID>6jzfr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1415844586.0</commentCreated><commentID>cm0k2xd</commentID><commentText>This is pretty disgusting.

Some scattered thoughts:

The real power hierarchy ought to have Bloomberg above the board of trustees. In all seriousness, the weight he swings is unbelievable and the university knows that keeping him happy is literally worth billions of dollars. The thing is, he has clear ideas about how his money should be used that don't necessarily intersect with the interests of the faculty or student body. That's his prerogative and I don't want to sound like he isn't a huge benefactor, but his gifts have strings attached that ought to be examined. The university is clearly frustrated by this at times - witness the awkward dance to get Bloomberg Distinguished Professors at KSAS - but is basically beholden to him for the duration of his life.

There should really be more on the university's financial situation. From the administration's perspective, KSAS is actually poor. The university endowment is large, but much of it is tied up in the other schools. This led to many of problems that the Dean's Strategic Plan was meant to address. The administration thinks of the Ivies and Stanford as our peer institutions and wants to match them in faculty:student ratio and other measures (that coincidentally are taken into account in the US News and World Report rankings). Most of these schools are able to fund most of their operating expenses out of their endowment, whereas about 80% of KSAS' budget is funded on a year to year basis by tuition revenues. To simplify a bit, the administration thinks it's necessary for the school to live beyond its means in order to bolster its status. The consequences for this are far flung and will be clearer ten years or so in the future after the DSP has been in effect for some time. Anyways, because the vast majority of undergrads are in KSAS, it'd be worth including more specific KSAS funding info, especially since it has been much at issue in the past year.

I'm always interested in building undergrad/grad student solidarity and would be willing to get coffee and discuss the document and the DSP issues if the writers of this document PM me.

I agree that the unsubstantiated comments about the frats are out of place. At many points the tendency to lean toward snark rather than substantial info is disappointing. The last few pages could be rewritten. A list of links to popular blogs? Really?</commentText><authorName>mybaltimoreaccount</authorName><authorID>7f3xh</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1412228398.0</commentCreated><commentID>ckxui3k</commentID><commentText>Anybody else sense a striking resemblance to Roger Goodell??

"Among the steps we are taking are: 

&#183;         Developing a JHU Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Website (http://www.sexualassault.jhu.edu/), announced by the Provost and launched in July 2014 with the input of our students.

&#183;         Activating the University-wide JHU Sexual Assault Helpline as a 24/7 confidential resource available to all students.

&#183;         Creating the position of victim&#8217;s advocate and enhancing the resources that we apply to student services and education in this area.

&#183;         Establishing a standing Sexual Violence Advisory Committee of students, faculty and staff, to provide community input and advice on matters pertaining to education, training, and prevention, policies and procedures, and community engagement.

&#183;         Forming a leadership-level Title IX working group to provide ongoing review of policies, practices, procedures, and programming relevant to sexual misconduct.

&#183;         Revising the University&#8217;s policies and procedures governing sexual and relationship-based violence in light of the University&#8217;s experience, the Campus SaVE Act, and recent guidance from the Department of Education and the White House.

These initial actions reflect the imperative we place on addressing sexual violence across our campuses. There is more work to be done, and we know well that solutions to such a persistent challenge will have a lasting impact only if they reflect the voices and perspectives of our community, and most especially our students.

We invite your feedback and welcome your participation as we work together to ensure a Johns Hopkins that is safe, supportive and free of sexual violence.

Sincerely,

Ronald J. Daniels"

The kitchen/lounge areas are really great for getting people together for meals. Frequently we'd all get together for dinner rotations, where one person would cook for anyone who wanted, with people taking turns. Zero obligation to join in, but great for people who wanted to take part. Come to think of it, that kind of captured the mood of the whole dorm: here's a bunch of group things you can do that pertain to healthy living, do whatever you like. There was no problem with people going out to party or doing their own thing. All in all, it was a very nice community. 

Note, your results, and dorm culture, may vary with who is living there. </commentText><authorName>Jernon</authorName><authorID>48r1w</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>2ck2j3<comments><comment><commentCreated>1407237135.0</commentCreated><commentID>cjh7fxi</commentID><commentText>You could be super underground and go for the steam tunnels</commentText><authorName>slthomp2</authorName><authorID>8jyvf</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1407155320.0</commentCreated><commentID>cjga8ip</commentID><commentText>hac lab?</commentText><authorName>hungryhungryhippooo</authorName><authorID>86z7y</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1407231194.0</commentCreated><commentID>cjh4j1t</commentID><commentText>The Bun Shop in Mt Vernon is open until 3am</commentText><authorName>MYGODWHATHAVEIDONE</authorName><authorID>4qysi</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1407229201.0</commentCreated><commentID>cjh3jok</commentID><commentText>This post is so JHU. </commentText><authorName>ZacharyMD</authorName><authorID>gpyyc</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1407339535.0</commentCreated><commentID>cjic28w</commentID><commentText>Took orgo this summer so I know your pain.

You can put money on your JCard and use that or use quarters, and monitor the machines on eSuds, a website that will show how many machines are open and how much time is left on them (although you can just hang out in the lounge if you don't want to go back upstairs). 

The trick is to find a weird time to do laundry...the most popular times are weeknights and Sunday. If you have a mid-day break during the week do it then.

For dry cleaners (if you frequently wear dressy clothes) the one next to Eddie's Market on St. Paul between 31st and 32nd is good...expensive, but 99% of the time you can get your stuff back the next day. And they're open from 7:30 AM-10 PM.

Keep in mind that the neighborhood is not the best, just be watchful at night etc and you'll be fine.

As to the website, I don't know that it really gets much traffic, you might be better off looking at Craigslist to see if anyone is looking for roommates, though they may or may not be hopkins affiliates.

Do you enjoy reading and writing fiction? If you're less confident and/or don't like fiction, take Expos. If the opposite, take IFP. IMO IFP will probably be easier, but if you want to improve your writing take Expos. Both will have people from a wide variety of majors, and if you can't fit in IFP freshman year you can take it later. With Expos though, be aware that some are terrible and some are not as terrible; IFP can actually be fun and you have to really mess up to do worse than a B.

A lot of people don't take Freshman Seminars. I took one and really enjoyed it, because it both allows you to dive into a topic in a small class size (15-18 maximum) and you get to meet other freshmen who are interested in things you may be interested in. It won't ruin your experience if you don't take one though.</commentText><authorName>ac91</authorName><authorID>658hi</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1403679578.0</commentCreated><commentID>cig78jv</commentID><commentText>It's not that uncommon for engineering students to not take IFP or Expos, but a lot of them do.  My friends who have taken those two courses said that whether you get a good TA in your section basically determines if you love or hate the class.

A few of my friends and I have never taken those classes (I think it's more work than a lot of other W classes), and we don't plan to either.  The W courses that I took or that I've seen a lot of other engineering students take are Intro to Business, Culture of the Engineering Profession and Bioethics; there are also a few random W classes every semester that you could choose from if those don't sound interesting.

Idk much about freshman seminar classes (I only took one freshman spring, and I wish I had 'spent' that credit on something more useful), but a few common humanities classes that a lot us took to finish up our 18 credits are:

* Intro to Business/Bioethics (again, these count for both, I believe)
* Intro Sociology
* Social Psych
* Elem. of Macroeconomics (though a lot of them didn't like it..)
* A year of some language

As for the concentration, that basically means you need to have three humanities courses that are 'focused' in one area.  For example, I took Intro to Business, Business Law I, and Business Law II.  These are all in the same concentration area, and both Business Law classes are 300 level + so they fulfill the requirement (you need at least one class that's 300+).  Idk much about other departments, but I imagine if you took something like IFP, IFP II and then Intro to Fiction or something, that would also count.

We have to take either ifp or expos as our writing credit. Other writing intensive classes will not count towards the writing credit. As far as humanities go many meches like to take them mixed with other classes as a break from engineering and math. Some took them all senior year to have an easy senior year. I'd advise taking the writing credit with covered grades first semester. That way it's done and you don't need to take another writing intensive besides senior design if you don't want to. The three classes in a concentration refer to your upper level meche electives. You don't need to worry about it right now and will have a better idea about it junior year.

Likewise, almost no student who brought in an AB score of 4 got an A in Calculus II (the logical next step)."

Data Structures would also be a fine first course though, and probably easier since it's taught in Java. You definitely don't need to take Intermediate first.

As for the AI stuff, it might be worth emailing a professor or two with these questions.

Slightly more specifically, "AI" as a field isn't particularly well-defined anymore.  The huge growth in machine learning has mostly supplanted traditional search-based AI (witness the rise of conferences like ICML and the presence of machine learning at AAAI and IJCAI), although there's definitely still interesting work going on in multi-agent systems and other areas that I'm not super familiar with.  I don't know much about "symbolic systems",  but there's been a bit of a backlash against logic-based mechanisms since the rise of machine learning.  On the other hand, there's been somewhat of a surge of interest lately in automated and machine-checkable theorem proving (e.g. the new work on homotopy type theory).  Robotics is kind of its own thing.

At JHU, if you're interested in AI then I'd recommend talking with some of the machine learning people in the CS department.  Raman Arora is our hardcore machine learning expert, but lots of people do a fair amount of machine learning both for its own sake and for specific applications (e.g. Jason Eisner, Ben van Durme, Ben Langmead, Alexis Battle, and Suchi Saria all come to mind).    

I'm not sure if anyone is actively working on neural nets, but again that's in part because neural nets isn't a particularly active field.  There are still some people working on it, but it's not what it was.  Take a look at the proceedings of NIPS (http://nips.cc/ ), which is probably the most well-known conference for neural nets.  There are very few actual neural nets papers in there anymore. 

But again, this is all just my opinion -- I'm no AI expert.  As a theoretician, I'd say learning more math is never a bad idea.  As someone else mentioned, though, you should talk with Joanne.</commentText><authorName>mdinitz</authorName><authorID>6jd5w</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1402656133.0</commentCreated><commentID>ci6903r</commentID><commentText>I've taken both Data Structures and Intermediate.

Go straight into Orgo. Do this so much. Your advisers will try to tell you otherwise and make you take an inbetween chem course to prepare you for Orgo. It will make your schedule harde nowr but the rest of your college carrier easier so you dont have to take annoying gen eds when you're an upper classman.



Easy elective- Intro to cog psyc (not writing intensive tho) 



Medium elective- Intro to fiction and poetry (fun if you have a good TA, writing intensive, not hard unless you cant write like me, even then not too bad) 



If you have orgo and orgo lab in that schedule that might be pushing 16 or 17 credits. Which is fine, but might be tough as your first semester in college. But might be worth it if you have covered grades (not sure anymore) it would be great to get some of your tougher classes out of the way which is what your schedule looks like. 



Chem major here: If you're not complely sold on ChemBE let me know if you have any questions!

For Chemistry classes, I would recommend either going to Gen Chem or taking the plunge and going to Orgo. The in between sequence is significantly more difficult than either of the other sequences, especially Chemical Structure and Bonding. I had IB Credit but I didn't want to go to Orgo - in retrospect I really regret that decision. I ended up taking Applied Chemical Equilibrium my first semester, and Chemical Structure and Bonding my second semester. 

Chemical Structure and Bonding will only have been taught for the second time next year - my year was the first year the class was offered. There's still significant improvements that need to be made to the class. The class is even more difficult than Orgo in my opinion. I'm taking Orgo over the summer  (which is also an option I highly recommend) and it's much easier/more understandable than Chemical Structure and Bonding

Orgo is honestly not as hard as its made out to be. Make no mistake it is a difficult class but it's a class where you just need to keep on top of the material and work on it everyday. So if you can do that a B+ is probably the least you'll score if not higher. 

Only Chem majors can take Orgo lab their first semester so that should open up your schedule a bit.

I would highly recommend taking Expos, Intro to Expos, or IFP b/c you're pre med so your writing intensives should be in the English department. Kill two birds with one stone by getting both the Writing Intensives for graduation and pre med out of the way.

Hope this helps.</commentText><authorName>team_avatar</authorName><authorID>gnfe6</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1402563782.0</commentCreated><commentID>ci5ao6w</commentID><commentText>Don't want to be annoying and start a new thread...but see my flair.

The commute is not bad in the morning.  If you leave before 8 am, it's around 25 minutes.  I have not seen a morning commute greater than 40 minutes in a VERY long time.  It's longer in the evening, specifically if you leave after 5 pm.  Usually around 40 minutes, if there are accidents I usually just choose to run errands in Columbia and wait until traffic dies down. I also choose to work a slightly altered schedule of 7:30-4 on ideal days.  Side note: I live extremely close the 95, which significantly helps.  JHU Homewood campus is not near 95.  I lived there for the first couple weeks I started at the lab, and that makes the commute more like an hour.  I would avoid this.

I unfortunately can't house anyone, but if you have access to the APL network and Cooler, you can check out there.  That would probably be your best option.  You can PM me if you have any other APL specific questions.</commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>26iv47<comments><comment><commentCreated>1401156158.0</commentCreated><commentID>chrko7h</commentID><commentText>I'd say CS. In this modern age, almost every company needs people who can program. On the other hand I'm not sure an AMS minor would distinguish you that much as most people have taken a class in prob/stats.

So I guess what it really comes down to is the fact that CS will increase your usefulness to many fields (computational biology, robotics, web dev, etc.) as it gives you general skills which many do not have/cannot learn, whereas AMS is far more specific as an analytical subject.

Not because diff eq relies on multivariable concepts too much (maybe a partial derivative here and there) but because diff eq is conceptually more abstract and could be a tougher class. The difference in difficulty is pretty small, though, IMHO. 

Then again, summer classes allow for (and require) focused &amp; uninterrupted study of one subject for a few weeks. So it might be a better way to approach learning a difficult subject. 

If I were you, I'd go on Wikipedia and read about multivariable calculus and differential equations, and just take whichever interests you more. Calc 3 is about differentiating and integrating 3D (and higher dimensional) quantities, whereas diff eq involves deducing the future behavior of a system based on how it changes moment-to-moment. </commentText><authorName>textbased</authorName><authorID>7bfer</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1401156604.0</commentCreated><commentID>chrkutx</commentID><commentText>I took Diff Eq two summers ago.

The main difference between Diff Eq and Calc III is that Calc III is more theoretical in nature (and the book sucks ass) whereas Diff Eq is simply the study of a few methods of solving differential equations, i.e. all you have to do is memorize a few processes, sort of like how we memorize the quadratic formula to solve quadratic equations.</commentText><authorName>MyTribeCalledQuest</authorName><authorID>4omi4</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>26h0b3<comments><comment><commentCreated>1401105127.0</commentCreated><commentID>chr7c6e</commentID><commentText>I cannot speak to retaking the class as I did ok the first time around, but I can speak a little bit about economics courses in general.

I think the key with economics courses in general (and especially the intro classes) is developing economic intuition. I think Hamilton tries to do that in class the best he can, but a lot of it is just learned by understanding concepts thoroughly in your own head. What does perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, etc. actually mean? WHY is the PPC shaped the way it is? You can memorize the reasons and definitions he gives, but I feel it's hard to do well until you understand the intuition behind them, whatever that means to you.

Also, I'd suggest studying with someone else (or yourself) and actively explain the intuition behind each thing he talked about in class. It's easy to sit in lecture or learning den and think you understand things, it's a real test to explain to an imaginary class or study mate the meaning behind perfect competition. Also, try to explain it in terms of them knowing no prior information, don't just regurgitate what Hamilton said in class and confirm that you know it, really think about it.

I think intro micro can be a hard class for some people, particularly if econ is not your primary focus, but I think getting a good, intuitive grasp on the main concepts discussed in class (PPC, types of firms, costs, indifference curves, etc.) will help a lot.

Best of luck!</commentText><authorName>gogogadgt</authorName><authorID>dk5tr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1401456235.0</commentCreated><commentID>chunhl4</commentID><commentText>**Take it over the summer**

It basically listed fields like "if you majored in mathematics you can be a: teacher, banker, etc, etc."  It was the biggest waste of time ever, and completely useless.  They will also happily check your resume for spelling mistakes, but beyond that don't expect much.

I got my job completely on my own, and I'm quite certain a REU/internship position I had the summer after my junior year landed me the position.  Anyways, I got a fantastic job through applying online on the laboratory's webpage.  In my experience, Hopkins does little to place anyone into a job.  There are career fairs on campus hosted by the career center, and recruiters also visit campus but often there will be 100+ people vying for the same one position available.

1. In my case they didn't send an email, but they could very well now. You can ask advising.

2. It's not that big of a deal in terms of what you need to do to fix it. I don't know how it affects med school, again you can ask advising. What will happen is they'll set you up with an adviser. You'll meet with somebody who will go into why this happened, what the best way to prevent it in the future is, and if there's anything more you'll need. They will assign you a mentor who will meet with you every so often (maybe once a week or once every other week) and they'll help you improve study habits, help you with classes you struggle with, and just help you get back on track. 

You'll be able to retake the class and it will be replaced on your transcript with an R. Academic probation isn't meant to be a punishment, it's meant to help you. Go into it determined to fix whatever led to it in the first place, and you'll do fine. You can ask them all the questions you have. You could even call them up now to ask.

I wonder what the university's official response to this investigation will be.

And now we're finding out about it from a source OTHER THAN THE UNIVERSITY. 

It's like me and high school math. I wasn't great at it and I didn't do well in my math classes. So naturally, to avoid the wrath of my parents, I didn't tell them and hoped it would go away. Well, parent-teacher conferences came up and the truth came out. The backlash from that was much stronger than it would have been had I just told my parents right away.

I learned my lesson in high school and the university still hasn't learned it.

Every Hopkins worker would earn at least $14 an hour by the end of the four-year contract. The union initially pushed for a $15-an-hour "living wage" for all workers with four years of service.

Title is a little (just a little) misleading, $15/hour for someone with 15 years of experience is very different from demanding 15/hour for an Associate right out of high school. After the four year contract the minimum would be 14 however, which would certainly set Hopkins far apart from most other employers in the state.</commentText><authorName>Halefire</authorName><authorID>5z1qx</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>22gsob<comments><comment><commentCreated>1396950451.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgmssux</commentID><commentText>Physics major here. Michael Bloomberg recently gave a butt load of money to the school and a lot of it went into the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy, conveniently located next to the Space Telescope Science Institute. Bloomberg is awesome. All of your physics classes and labs will be in there and the labs, classrooms, and lecture halls are all really nice. There is a physics lab for undergraduates to work together on homework and it is awesome. You will find that in college, doing physics homework independently might not work out so well and working in a group in a room surrounded by whiteboards is very conducive to truly understanding the subject. Every professor at JHU conducts research and a lot of them have multiple teams. There are even more people at STSI who are not professors but professional astronomers. All of these people (there are hundreds) are doing very important things in the world of Physics (Think LHC, nobel laureates, Hubble telescope, etc.). If astro is what you're into, this is really a great place to be. I am researching stars, more specifically their distribution in the Milky Way and different methods of calculating their distance. I got this position simply by emailing professors, "Hey I'm a physics major, I love your work and would like to be a part of it." Multiple professors responded and I met with many and even had to turn some down. This is what makes JHU really amazing in my opinion.  JHU spends over 2 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR on research. That number is insane, more than MIT, Stanford, Princeton, or any other school. Not to mention half of that goes to the JHU Applied Physic Lab. Oh and also I'm a freshman. Yes, I am a freshman doing astrophysical research with an awesome professor at a world-renowned university in something that I am passionate about. The best thing is that I am no exception. 70% of students do research at some point and it is readily available. So research at JHU, A+ all the way. Its a very important part of JHU's philosophy and an important part of getting everything you can out of the university. Whatever you're into I promise you that you will find a professor who is interested in the same thing and there is nothing stopping you from dropping by their office or sending an email inquiring about joining in their study. I urge you to check out the physics and astronomy website and see for yourself. Also check out the movie Particle Fever. I actually ran into Dr. Kaplan (the guy with the ponytail if you watch the trailer or the movie) today on my way to class. But research obviously isn't all there is to your education here. Like many top schools, you will find that some professors who are brilliant physicists are absolute shit at teaching physics. If you are a physics major, you will never take a physics class that has more than ~40 people in it. I promise. This means that you can have a lot of individualized attention and the grad students (there are many) can be very helpful. On the other hand a lot of them and the professors as well are just oblivious and only care about their research. Some can't even speak english. So some professors suck and others you will love. I'd give the instruction here a B. Not bad, but certainly could be better. If you have other questions concerning the school (atmosphere, social life, etc.) or anything else about Physics just message me. I know this is long but as a physics student here I feel obligated to tell you everything about it and a lot I have left out. To answer your specific questions. As a freshman, I can't really answer physics advising as I don't yet have an advisor (you get one at the end of freshman year). All internships take place during the summer so no need to worry about commuting. That question is kind of irrelevant to JHU though. I know nothing about the Carnegie Institution nor other internships in DC. It's not like JHU will just give you an internship. You have to apply and enhance your resume and interview and get recommendations (all of which you can do here obviously). So seriously message me if you want to ask more questions because as a freshman physics major I am literally exactly where you could be in a year. </commentText><authorName>rip_the_fabric</authorName><authorID>fxi42</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1396958986.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgmwst9</commentID><commentText>Just graduated from the department last year.  The department has a lot of great professors, and also the Space Telescope Science Institute across the street, giving you access to a lot of people you can do research with if you're interested in their work.  I knew people who did research with Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in 2011, doing astronomy work, people who did particle research with the data from the LHC, people who had interesting condensed matter labs, and people who dealt with instrumentation and building satellite components.  The research opportunities you want are there.  

As far as quality of professors and classes goes, I think the department is pretty strong.  Physics majors take their own version of Physics 1 and 2 separate from the rest of the university, which I think is pretty great.  You get a smaller class with more personal attention, and you typically get some great professors teaching.  Also it gives you a great chance to meet most of the people also doing Physics in your year.  Not every professor is amazing, but I doubt that's the case anywhere.  For almost all of my courses, though, I got the feeling that the professor was interested in teaching the material and working with the class, and many were incredibly accessible for office hours.  

SPS, the society of physics students, is constantly putting out bulletins for internship and research opportunities, both near and far.  I don't think I knew anyone who commuted to internships during the year, though.  I saw it mostly over the summer.  That said, that could also just be because of the time consuming nature of commuting if you were to head into the DC area.  I got a research fellowship one summer that wasn't local, so I don't know much about summer internships in the area, but I know a few people who were at APL for the summer.  I believe they got housing closer to DC for the summer, rather than commute, though.  

One other thing that you didn't ask about, but I think is worth mentioning, is that all of my friends and I that finished with a degree in Physics are either employed or in grad school, or are about to start after purposely taking some time off.  Among the people I know, not one of them had trouble finding placement after finishing their degree.  Pretty happy to see things work out like that.  </commentText><authorName>Jernon</authorName><authorID>48r1w</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1396949924.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgmsj8y</commentID><commentText>I'm not a physics major but have taken a number of upper level physics elective, all of which have been stellar.  Interesting, engaging professors (specifically Dr. Leheny who is a super cool dude).  Even way back when I took wave phenomena (probably the hardest class I've taken here and notorious amongst biophysics majors for sucking), Dr. Robbins was super chill, very accessible and a really great professor. Intro level classes are hard to teach well, regardless of department.

I think it's a pretty small major which, speaking as someone in another small major, is usually a pretty good way to go here.  Your professors will know you on a personal level which is awesome.  Also, I am pretty sure physics majors have a pretty sweet study/lab area on the fourth floor of Bloomberg (the physics building), which I only mention because having a communal space for studying really facilitates working together on problem sets/studying together in general which, in my opinion, is the best way to learn.  I'm not sure if physics majors here actually do this but it's a good resource, regardless. All of the physics majors I know have gotten involved in the research they're interested in.  http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/research/ theres the research done here.

As for your other questions, I can't really comment.  I would encourage you to reach out to the admissions office.  They can put you in touch with someone from physics who can answer your questions.</commentText><authorName>nikhils_orange</authorName><authorID>5u97d</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1396948473.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgmrtar</commentID><commentText>Thanks for the info.

I recently graduated as a physics major, and was a board member of SPS. Additionally, I had an internship at JHU APL and am now employed full time and working on a masters in applied physics part time through Hopkins. I loved my time at Hopkins as a Physics major. A lot of the people I know who majored in other departments at Hopkins had a very different sense of the school, mostly because of how incredible the physics department is. This is a department that really does care about the well being of it's students. Will they reduce the work because you say it's too hard? Not likely. However, if you tell them that the textbook is awful and does more harm than good, they'll listen. In fact, every year, the end of the spring semester, there's a meeting between the professors and the students where they discuss upcoming changes in the department, and ask for the input of the students. 
I would agree with rip_the_fabric, that Hopkins Physics is great for research. It's obviously going to better in astrophysics, but it's condensed matter and particle physics are also pretty awesome. I had absolutely no trouble getting research as a sophomore. All I really did was walk up to my professor, ask if he had any research opportunities for an undergraduate, and he said yes. So the research is not just amazing, but it's easy to get. 

The classes can also get really small, which is awesome. One of the best experiences I've had in a class was when it was two undergraduates and one graduate. That's it. I learned so much, I was able to ask a ton of questions and it was just an incredible experience. I would disagree with rip_the_fabric about the grade he gave the professors. I can only think of two or three professors who I thought were not up to par. Compare this to the +30 faculty that make up the physics department, and that's a pretty good number if you ask me. I found almost all of them cared about their students learning and understanding the material. Additionally, they gave me great advice, outside of academics. When I was deciding on what to do after graduate, I spoke to a few professors and all of them gave me excellent advice. I had Adam Riess as my advisor and he was really chill, and was very helpful. The same goes for the TAs. However, the academic experience in the physics department is entirely what you make of it. If you want to take just the required courses, you're allowed to. However, you won't have classes like the one I had with three people in it. I found that the more courses I took in the physics department, the more I enjoyed the experience of being there. 

There's one thing I'd like to mention that you didn't ask about that I know Jernon can testify to as well, and that's the social dynamics. SPS, the introduction classes (I recommend you take them and not test out), and PUC (physics undergraduate computing lab) are the structures provided to you by the department that allow you to form strong, and long lasting friendships. SPS is a meeting of people who are interested in physics and physics majors where they have professors talk about their research, watch movies, and have fun. It's an incredible place to meet people in your major and have fun. PUC is absolutely amazing. There is no other major, and I doubt there is a program anywhere in the country that has something like PUC. PUC is an absolutely massive room dedicated to undergraduate physics majors. You basically have key card access to this huge study space any time of day, with white boards (and a few chalk boards) on every wall. There are comfortable couches and chairs in the upstairs area as well. It became not just an academic refuge, but a social meeting point for many of us. 

One thing I would recommend, if you do choose to major in physics, regardless of where you go, is to take a couple of courses in some engineering field. You don't have to major or even minor in it, but if you like programming take one or two courses in computer science. If you like statistical analysis, take some courses in modeling and simulation or statistical analysis. If you like building things, learn a bit about electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. If you choose not to go to grad school this holds especially true. Being a physics major doesn't just mean you know physics, it means you know how to learn and how to think outside the box. However, it's always good to have a bit of technical knowledge.

As for the main physics department itself, not a fan. Physics 101 is notorious for being a terrible class--some lecturers pretty good, some lecturers **awful**.

I'll list what my premed advisor told me I needed to take and where it intersects or doesn't with ChemBE:

* 2 bio courses + lab (we do have to take 2 bio courses (which may change for your class), but labs are not mandatory so you'd need to take them)
* 2 semesters of orgo + 1 lab (we only need 1 semester of orgo, so you'll be lacking a little be here)
* 2 writing courses (we need credits in the general area of humanities and social sciences with some being writing intensive, but premed requires 2 classes to be in the writing department itself. so there can be overlap in this area if done correctly)

That's where your only problems with lie. For premed you also need 2 semsters of chem + labs, 2 semesters of physics + lab, and 2 semesters of math, but all of those are required for ChemBE as well so you'll be covered. Essentially you need Orgo II, Orgo lab, bio courses/labs, and make sure some of your distribution credits are in the writing department.

You shouldn't have too much trouble switching Sophomore year, and you definitely won't have a problem freshman year switching. Keep in mind that things change a little with AP/IB credits as some courses may need to be retaken, but if anything it only helps.

The fact that public health department makes it P/F and requires you to write a 10 page report, along with every weekly diaries even though it can be 1 credit makes it really NOT worth the effort. Some weeks, I'd go to labs and sit there doing behavioral experiments and summarize it as my report only to get a reply back that it was not good enough...I literally had to get my PI to write a note saying that it takes us a month or two to get good hard data so that I wouldn't be kicked out of the research credits.

The poli sci department, on the other hand...

Like every department it has good and bad. There are some excellent professors and some terrible ones; there are some excellent classes and some terrible ones. The terrible ones were really bad, though, and I seemed to have bad luck with TAs.

I never did research because by the time I would have had enough of a base to be of any use as a research assistant I was commuting to DC twice a week for internships I secured on my own. Also, the idea of spending my time doing academic research didn't appeal to me at all.

The course difficulty wasn't much of an issue. I got one B-, two B's, and about 12-13 higher grades. There wasn't too much of a jump between 200 and 400 level classes in terms of difficulty or workload, and I never felt truly overwhelmed by the work.

Advising was just complete shit. I had no relationship with my advisor, and considering his field of expertise was entirely different than mine he really didn't have much to offer me with course selection and internship searching.

In all, the department isn't terrible, but there are some glaring flaws (persistently broken courses they never fix, bad advising, not much in the way of working with students to get DC internships) that should be fixed. Also, the fact that internships are only 1 credit is insane. Junior year I worked 16 hours a week on Capitol Hill (more time than I spent in class during the week), but the amount of time I would have needed to spend securing the one credit and doing the attendant bullshit made it not worth it. I ended up getting 0 credits for internships.

EDIT: Here are things that work...flexibility of what you have to take (no required classes, only one class each required in American, international, political theory, and comparative)...interesting summer classes...American politics professors are generally very good.</commentText><authorName>ac91</authorName><authorID>658hi</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>22811e<comments><comment><commentCreated>1396697300.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgkh80i</commentID><commentText>This may be a good starting point: https://orchid.hosts.jhmi.edu/stujob/jobs.cfm</commentText><authorName>WalkThePlanck</authorName><authorID>3vr34</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1396739995.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgkq933</commentID><commentText>Tons of professors give paid research positions to undergrads who just walk into thier office and ask.</commentText><authorName>TheLeapIsALie</authorName><authorID>71wzj</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1396750461.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgku7kk</commentID><commentText>The rec center is hiring for most positions this summer http://web.jhu.edu/recreation/facilities/studentemployment.html</commentText><authorName>letsgohop</authorName><authorID>7db3b</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1397009652.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgnchbc</commentID><commentText>The library also hires students for the summer.These positions don't usually get posted on the student jobs website so just ask at the Circulation Desk or AV on A level if they have openings for the summer. </commentText><authorName>spiffypeach</authorName><authorID>4xajg</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>2257y1<comments><comment><commentCreated>1396653616.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgjy9wz</commentID><commentText>Anybody got some really easy H or S classes I can take if i don't get into Baltimore and the wire?? </commentText><authorName>kpbasketball93</authorName><authorID>6tz0t</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1396667529.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgk4zj9</commentID><commentText>How is introduction to bioethics? easy/ hard, interesting/boring?

LADE, being geared towards engineering majors, is much more relevant to what you'll be doing. There's less theory and more applications, which I really like. 

The only negative thing that I've heard about LADE is if you decide to pursue a higher degree, you might be at a disadvantage because you'll need more in-depth knowledge of the subject.

The 3 upper-level sciences courses are a pre-req because all the lectures will be completely over your head if you don't have some science background.

My program at JHU was very small and as a result the career center wasn't all that helpful. In the last few years the department chair and several alumni have teamed up and reached out to established JHU alumni and other contacts in the field. With these contacts the department has hosted its own career events such as Q&amp;A panels for all students, undergrad and grad. 

Perhaps it's something to bring up to the faculty in your own department. If this model is successful, which it seems it is, then it can be followed in other departments in the manner of a bottom-up approach, and then the career center could be a centralized unit that keeps track of each department's contacts and activities for students in other departments to check out. Just a thought. I think the events are used to help students find internships and ultimately have industry contacts/experience for when they graduate.

On a related note: my job search is a combination of applying through online applications, networking at local events and having my contacts reach out to their network in other regions of the U.S., and using Facebook/LinkedIn to reach out to Hopkins alumni in my target cities/industries for connections that get me around HR.

He seems like an okay guy, and english is his first language.  There are way worse options in terms of professors, so I'd say go for it.  

I think in terms of all math classes workload is highly dependent on the professor.  In terms of difficulty, I think everyone has different feels for analysis v. algebra.  Usually you are more capable at one versus the other, but unfortunately you have to take both.  If this is your first 400 level, you'll probably have to get used to writing proofs.  That is a fun transition.

Edit: P.S. I took the non-honors analysis at the undergrad level.  That was a huge waste of time.  Don't bother.  Ended up taking the grad version to make up for all the stuff I didn't learn.  Grad version is also infinitely more difficult.</commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1395723104.0</commentCreated><commentID>cgavdxc</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>211h8m<comments /></submission><submission>210w3v<comments /></submission><submission>20s7rb<comments><comment><commentCreated>1395241092.0</commentCreated><commentID>cg6c0z1</commentID><commentText>Find people who live in houses.

One World has all night happy hours on Wednesday, which includes half off all beer (and maybe wine.)  Maxie's runs specials like every night, but every drink I've ever had there was funky tasting, unless it came out of the sealed bottle.  CVP does half price munchies on Mondays, but as far as drink specials there I know they exist, but I have never figured out the timing.

As far as Hampden, Golden West runs specials often, some nights of the week you get a free Boh with any burger, other nights are like $2 draft beer (they have a killer selection.) Holy Frijoles has Margarita Monday, a basic margarita is $3.50.  

In Mt. Vernon, Brewer's Art does specials every weeknight until 7 pm where draft beer is $3.75.  Minato sushi also runs cocktail specials in the early evenings, I think most are under $5 (if you like the sushi thing.)

All in all, there is very sub par happy hour options in that part of town.  You'd be better to catch the circulator and head to other parts of the city.</commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1394283588.0</commentCreated><commentID>cfxb2e9</commentID><commentText>Mt.

Mick O'Sheas has $8 burger and pint after 6 on Mondays, always delicious. Midtown Yacht Club (bit divey) just always has cheap stuff I can't even keep track. Had a Yuengling bottle Thursday and it was $1.50, I think that was just normal for the afternoon; $3-4 rail drinks is ringing a bell. They also have 16 oz natty boh cans for $1.5, and that one is all the time if I'm not mistaken. Tavern on the Hill has half-price reubens and 92 cent natty boh drafts on Wednesdays: that one is the most insane deal I know of. Also, Brewer's as someone mentioned. Dooby's has $1 off beer, not especially exciting, but their craft selection is very refreshing, and they have a great hip environment. </commentText><authorName>Classh0le</authorName><authorID>8fchw</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1394253744.0</commentCreated><commentID>cfwzdej</commentID><commentText>cvp because i'm too lazy to go elsewhere.  one world if i'm *really* too lazy to go far.

Fake IDs aren't necessary to get into parties, but they help with buying booze for yourself. Just make sure to have your JCard and some cash whenever you go out. Some houses will charge $5, while some will let you in for free if your group's ratio of guys to girls is right. Make sure you have small bills handy, because the doormen occasionally run out of change and you end up paying $20 instead of $5.


Most fraternities don't have official houses, according to Baltimore law. SigEp's house was grandfathered in during the 80s, and both Pike and Wawa both own apartment buildings. However, there isn't really a best frat to pledge per se. Each fraternity has their own atmosphere that you may love or hate. 


This will sound really cliche, but spend a little bit of time at each fraternity, go to their parties, or just find a brother. You're going to be spending the next four years with these guys, so you better enjoy their company and their parties. Definitely look into how harsh pledging will be during the spring, because that can be a significant time drain you may not be able to afford.


tl;dr: No fakes needed.

Since I was an undergrad back when the original, and then the 2nd version, of jhu confessions sites were highly active, I saw a lot of cowardly bullying happen through those platforms.  Full names were used, and many posts including full name where pages upon pages of slut shaming.  I knew girls who ended up on that site, sometimes it was for good things like "she's bangin'", but usually it was calling various girls whores.  As an student community at an institution like Hopkins, we should be above that kind of behavior.  Those comments are on the internet for the entire world to see, with the victims' full names, and the writer just gets to hide behind an unnamed mask.  Just because your posts are anonymous on JHUC, doesn't mean it doesn't reflect poorly on the student body as a whole.  

If you want the world to respect you once you earn your Hopkins degree, do yourself a favor and learn how to become a respectful person, else you are just doing yourself and this school a huge disservice.

Going downtown I use St. Paul then Center Street / Monument (same as the jhmi shuttle).  Going uptown I use Madisson St. then Charles street.

I would advise you to stay away from Greenmount (particularly north of North ave.) even though it looks pretty direct.

I haven't had any serious problems but.....  

Around the intersection of Monument and Caroline street, I tend to find a lot of kids and teenagers who will pretend to throw stuff at me, actually throw stuff at me, spit at me, run into the middle of the street shouting, and just shouting in general.  This seems to have been getting worse the past six months or so, and I've found myself choosing not to ride.  I'd be happy to hear if anybody has a good way of dealing with this.

Takes about 20 mins going south, and maybe 30 mins going north because there's more uphill.  I'm not very fast though, I'm sure you could do better.

**Route A**


1) South on guilford ave bike line all the way down to Biddle St.

2) East on Biddle St

3) South on Broadway St and you're there


**Route B** 

1) Ride south on St. Paul St

2) Turn East right when you pass Penn Station (at Mt. Royal Ave)

3) Catch the separated bike track heading southeast, which many don't know to be the latter half of the jones falls trail 

4) Head east on Eager st.

I usually took Route A to work and Route B home. I would often get there and/or back faster than my friend who took the shuttle at the same times.

1.) Hopkins is one of the top schools for the major I'm interested in, I like the student/teacher ratio, a lot of opportunities, big undergrad research department, etc.

2.) I'm really excited to get involved in research about [insert here] because [insert reasons] and quidditch because [insert here].

No real "north" border to this area; I've never gone past Northern parkway, but after that is pretty much the county, and I don't know that area as well. So this area has Guilford, Roland Park, and Tuscany-Canterbury. I've never had any incidents running through here. I'd avoid Oakenshawe, though, around where University and 33rd intersect, I know there's been a few crime reports originating from that area. If you REALLY want to be on the safe side, keep your distance from York road.

I know I didn't mention Hampden/Keswick, but that's not because they're bad. I used to run through Hampden quite a lot, but it's quite commercial, so there's always people walking around on the sidewalk, and it makes running a little trickier. A nice route is running west through Hampden and under I-83 towards Woodberry, where there's a Light Rail station. Woodberry is beautiful, and I'd recommend taking a run there and back to campus (about 5 miles total) just to check it out.

I've run through Remington once, but it's not as good of a running area as the other areas I've mentioned. Same goes through Charles Village, where all the student rowhouses are between 33rd and 27th or so.</commentText><authorName>allofyourfeels</authorName><authorID>a32ck</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1389775933.0</commentCreated><commentID>cepqugd</commentID><commentText>The suggestions people have for running are good so far, but the campus loop is kind of short if you want to do longer runs. My loop was usually to run north on Charles or Greenway and then turn left to cut back to Roland Ave/University for a nice big loop. It's a little hilly (good training!) and really residential with decent sidewalks. Pretty scenery too. Use Cold Spring to cut back for a 3 mile loop, Wyndhurst for a 4 miler with a killer hill, or Northern for a 5 miler. Tack on the campus loop if you want for an extra ~2 miles or so but be careful on San Martin.

I'd say that N. Charles is probably the best street to walk down since it is reasonably well lit at and there is a lot of businesses around there (Every so often I walk alone to the CVS on 25th street with no problems, although it is usually still light outside). Just be aware of your surroundings and don't look like you're lost, i.e. using your cell phone.

In terms of running, have you ever tried the campus loop? N Charles to Art Museum Dr. to San Martin to University and then back to N Charles. It's pretty nice with a good amount of both slightly inclined up and down hill. Just note that San Martin does not have a sidewalk from the parking lot next to the admissions building to the parking lot with the bridge, so remember to be aware and run on the opposite side of the street as the cars.

Modern wasn't for me, but the teacher is really nice and I have a lot of friends that love her classes. I've been going to the ballet classes for multiple semesters. It is a great class for absolute beginners and a great class for advanced dancers. You can dance at your own level, and you can take the class on pointe if you wish. If you ever have to miss a class you can, as long as you email the teacher. She is really laid-back. If you have any more specific questions about the free ballet classes, ask. Also, FYI, the JHU Ballet Club offers free ballet classes at well, Monday nights 7-9 advanced/intermediate and Wednesday nights 8-9 beginner. The Monday night class is great for a more advanced dancer.</commentText><authorName>ali902</authorName><authorID>9vjee</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1388889681.0</commentCreated><commentID>ceh94f4</commentID><commentText>The ballet classes are great!

Current students can probably give you a better idea of what classes to avoid.

But the other guys are right, you're gonna get that pretty often in the natural sciences, regardless of what university you go to. Are there more of them at Hopkins? Maybe.

Why put yourself through that when you can have friends moments away? I assure you the people you live with are so much more important than how you will be living. Sure the A/B rooms are better to hang out in but it's no fun if you have no one to hang out with!

To put it another way, people in the AMR's tend to form posses out of their housemates. You are guaranteed to be a member of one of those if you live in the AMRs. If you live in A/B, these are generally not formed out of who you live with and a lot of people from the Buildings join one from the AMRs but sometimes they don't and just end up being locked out. Those are the people complaining about having no friends in JHU Confessions. 

You only get to be a freshman once and you can live in suite style dorms or apartment style for the rest of your college career.

Humility. 

I've been thinking a lot about what Hopkins has given me, and I keep coming back to this one thing. This school will grind you. It will take whatever naive belief you have in your superiority and crush it. It will take your perceptions about the glory of academic research and replace it with the realities of science funding and lab grunt work in modern academia. It will go to great lengths to ensure that you realize that it is virtually impossible to do anything meaningful on your own and that you will need to ask for help to achieve things. 

There's a very real difference between arrogance and self-confidence. The first I think is where you feel like you should know everything. In this case when you realize you don't it's almost paralyzing. The second is where you know exactly where your limits lie and that it's perfectly fine to reach out to others when you encounter something you can't fully comprehend. 

We have our own share of arrogant people, because some individuals will always be that way. But I think Hopkins is among a increasingly smaller number of schools where the environment is engineered to change arrogant people into self-confident ones. It's really hard to think you're the best ever when you're only an average student at Hopkins and getting B-'s in your core classes. 

In the short term, this is somewhat problematic. There will be long bouts of unhappiness and self doubt and a sense of imposter's syndrome. In terms of what is probably better for you in the long haul, it's easy for me to say that what Hopkins puts you through is worth it. 

If this hasn't convinced you and you want actually want an easy go around in college, then I suggest making the opposite choice that I did and take advantage of [the alarming grade inflation at one of our peer institutions.](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/3/grade-inflation-mode-a/) </commentText><authorName>jhu</authorName><authorID>57uyu</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1386596485.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdx7wg6</commentID><commentText>I think it's silly to base your application decision on sports clubs or "interesting activities" on campus. You're going to find plenty of things that you like at any school you go to.

However, I want to say that if you want to go into research, Hopkins is a fantastic place to do that. The biology classes here are great and really teach you to think like a scientist, and research opportunities are plentiful. There are multiple undergraduate research fellowships you can apply for and in general the atmosphere of the school is one that cultivates undergraduate research. The students here are trusted by the faculty and if you want to do research as a scientist (as opposed to a research assistant) with your own project of which you are the primary intellectual driver, then you will be able to do that here. Although I'm sure this isn't something that's unique to Hopkins, I can say that I truly received world-class training from my professors and research mentors.

I loved my time here, and did not share the negative experiences voiced by others in this thread. I can't speak for BME, which is undoubtably tougher than a lot of majors here, but a lot of biology majors also complain about grade deflation, which is puzzling because most of the biology classes here are normalized and not truly curved. I remember getting a score in the 80s once in biochemistry that ended up being normalized to something like 130%, which is ridiculous. Or graduate level biology courses where half the class automatically gets an A. These are the extreme examples, but I found that most of my core science classes were fairly generous. Of course, it's human nature to seek external sources of non-ideal situations so the things you hear aren't surprising. The bottom line is that just because other places have inflation, it doesn't mean that we have deflation. I won't deny that some classes can be challenging, but it really takes a certain amount of self-centeredness to believe that we are the only difficult school that exists and that the problems people complain of are unique to or "engineered" for this school.</commentText><authorName>sp808</authorName><authorID>6c86a</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1386585529.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdx3b1h</commentID><commentText>Check out JHOC and Intramurals </commentText><authorName>AdamJaz</authorName><authorID>3d6i6</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1386587336.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdx43ya</commentID><commentText>I play a club sport, do research and generally have a really great time here.

You seem to have your heart set on a career in molecular biology, but I would encourage you to be open to switching majors/paths as your passions dictate. I think Hopkins is a good place to be in you're into science in general since it allows you access to a number of very highly ranked programs. Have you considered the biophysics major?

Something that's different from a school like Harvard is JHU is hard work. You're not going to be handed grades. You will work your ass off. You'll have plenty of time for extracurriculars, parties, and even a job if you're so inclined. But you will work your ass off.

The thing I'm most grateful to JHU for is not what I learned, not my friendships, not the fun I had playing soccer or going on ACM scavenger hunts. It's the name on my diploma. The name "Johns Hopkins University" opens more doors than you can imagine. My GPA wasn't particularly good but most companies didn't even look at that when they saw that I graduated from JHU. In fact, the only job I was rejected from because of my GPA was one at the Social Security Administration, and we know how great that place operates.

If you're looking for a place where you'll spend most of your time having fun, don't go here. (Seriously, that's said without judgement. I almost regret the fact that JHU doesn't have football or basketball.) If you're looking for a place where you'll be challenged and set up for success, JHU is a fantastic option. Also, they have need-blind admissions and great financial aid, so that's a plus if you can't afford tuition to a private institution.</commentText><authorName>BagsOfMoney</authorName><authorID>51s5f</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1386662426.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdxszva</commentID><commentText>JHU is a world class university -- you'll find everything here that you'll find other places.

Some of the best classes I've had at JHU were taught by non-tenured prof and worst classes were by tenured ones. 

This is my experience from the Hist Dept. Imo, the tenured ones didn't put as much effort into their class instruction because they knew their position would not be jeopardized. Two of the newer history professors coming in were non-tenure and visiting were by far the BEST academic scholars and mentors I've had. They took time to actually help me with my research projects, met with me one on one throughout the week, and taught wonderful classes. This can hardly be said for the one other tenured prof who didn't give a shit about his class and was so lazy, the lecture slides didn't even have words on them half the time. I don't think decreasing tenure would be a bad thing, it'd make professors actually do what they are supposed to do instead of goofing around. This isn't to say that all tenured prof are bad, but I think non-tenure puts more pressure on them to teach well. </commentText><authorName>Gulagman</authorName><authorID>58qvp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1386459297.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdvuljw</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1386402712.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdvg0jf</commentID><commentText>What of these criticisms about corporate funding can't be applied to government funding?

Stress is a natural part of going to a school with a bunch of self-motivated people, and I don't deny it. Anyone who knows me in real life knows that I'm constantly freaking out about something, and that school isn't easy for me by any means. 

I don't think the purpose of the blog post was to tell everyone that it was going to be super easy here- I practically failed the test that my friends texted me to wake up for. I was trying to address the idea that students are out to get people, and that students are alone during their four years here, which is absolutely not true.

I also worked for the student PR team for admissions for awhile, and I approached that question completely differently.  Especially in one-on-one admissions interviews, I was blatantly honest.  It's tough.  It's not a walk in the park on a sunny day.  You're not going to be perfect all the time.  You are probably going to end up with test scores or a grade or two (or many) that you wish didn't happen.  

The most important thing is to grow and learn you have to understand and accept what you don't understand.  Without a struggle, the long run just isn't worth it.  I once had a math TA at Hopkins that told me to study for an exam I should do every single problem in the book until I get one wrong.  Once you get something wrong you've identified the limits in your knowledge.  College is not about boosting your ego, or hanging your grades on your parents' fridge, or making Dean's List every semester.  It's about gaining valuable and essential knowledge in your field so that you can solve real world problems after college, and to do that you need to identify and push those limits.  I'm probably where I am today because during my college experience I had some test scores that yelled, "Hey, you don't know as much as you thought, eh?" That pushed me to work harder and push myself to TRULY understand the field I was studying.  I am thankful that Hopkins drove me into the ground more than a few times because that's all I needed to push myself to do the best I possibly could.  

If you want a relaxing and carefree college experience, that's not Hopkins.  If you want to work hard, and reap those benefits in the future then it's a good choice.  You have to be willing to make some sacrifices and endure some pain, but it was worth it.</commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1385181401.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdkp415</commentID><commentText>I think from my experiences at JHU, I've seen some students go solo and done great, others failed, while at the same time, other students formed study groups to succeed etc. To each their own I guess. Being with a supportive group with SgtIceBucket and other JHU redditors really helps a lot when it came to studying for exams and tests. I'm not going to underplay how tough and stressful it can be at JHU. I've known a few people who even got sick because of the competition here (although this is probably very very rare). Her argument is based on a support group, and yes, those help tremendously, esp for studying and keeping yourself on task. Sometimes, it takes a hug from a friend or buying someone a coffee at Cafe Q to brighten up their day and help them get through it. 

Nevertheless, I don't think we should sell JHU the way she puts it. It's going to make a lot of people unprepared. I've known people who sabotaged others, yes there are people like that out there. I've almost had my books stolen in the library from going to the bathroom (luckily, the guy next to me asked why someone was taking my books). My RA said that during his year, someone pulled fire alarms during test nights. I think new students should take her blog as "helpful advice," namely form a study group. She's not debunking anything. Hopkins has a culture of cutthroat and competition all the way from undergraduate to graduate to the professors. Someone is always there to one-up you and it's your decision to react to it or not. I'm not saying that this competition is good or bad necessarily. The JHU environment has really challenged me as an individual and I've learned a lot. Namely, my work ethic now is top notch, I know when I can slack off and I know when I have to give 110%. It's prepared me for my professional life. I'm currently doing research at another hospital and I'm writing IRB protocols and grant proposals without any formal training because JHU has prepared me for these tasks. It puts me ahead of others who come from other colleges and my boss is more confident in what he assigns me than what he gives to grad students. </commentText><authorName>Gulagman</authorName><authorID>58qvp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1385180564.0</commentCreated><commentID>cdkor8d</commentID><commentText>In every major at every school, some people are cut throat, some are not.

Can't speak for science and engineering. From my perspective at least, the classes are both hard to do well in and not rigorous--your grades will suck if you don't try, which makes sense, but the class quality is so variable it's basically a crapshoot and many classes just don't teach you anything. This is especially true if you aren't planning on immediately going to grad school or don't do research, because then professors give less of a shit about you than they already do. If you come here, you better make sure you're really an academic and enjoy an academic atmosphere, which I am not.

Promoting an image of intellectual rigor is all well and good, but what's needed is an attitude change from everyone from administration to students. Take a breath and relax, because you will fuck up at least one class but your future employers really just don't care. It is possible for this place to be rigorous but not murderous but the people make that not so and reinforce a cutthroat atmosphere that isn't necessarily personally sabotaging others but more of an overall sense that your life will end if you get an A-. College is a practice run, albeit one that matters--treat it as such.

Both are 1 credit, just show up for attendance, and you get an A.

**520.142 Digital Systems Fundamentals** - Easy 3 credit class on computer logic stuff. Plus Professor Meyer throws out free books at you for fun.

Nothing worth taking for physics or chemistry other than prereqs.

I'm still pretty pissed that this even was an idea on the part of the school. We have one of the largest endowments AND one of the highest tuitions, yet this school still feels the urge to use every oppprotunity to take our money.

~~...If it's offered. The prof has been thinking about not doing the class anymore for a while so you'd have to find out. It's in the Writing Sems dept so you could ask them.~~ EDIT: It is currently on ISIS. 

It's a super easy class. You write a short opinion essay (literally impossible to be wrong) each week, and then during class you either read an essay aloud or watch a movie. That's seriously the whole class. Also, there's enough extra credit so that you can skip half the assignments (or attendance) Guaranteed A as long as you complete enough assignments by the end of the semester. </commentText><authorName>Sgt_Ice_Bucket</authorName><authorID>4tg7p</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1383635419.0</commentCreated><commentID>cd6twnh</commentID><commentText>The Rise of Modern Science

It was very doable if you're thinking about it. You should know that if Peter is teaching UI, there is going to be very little actual instruction. He doesn't even know the material and last year was the first time he "taught" it. I know Joanne has more experience and her class is a lot more structured. 

That being said, the first half of UI is weekly programming assignments ranging from reading the developer tutorial to building a basic to-do list application. The second half is a group project on an app of your choice or you will probably be given several options. 

On a side note, you are given phones by the department which comes in handy because the android emulator is pretty slow. We also had a very good TA who developed a lot in android and he more or less taught the class himself. His name was Mike, I think.

As for parallel, I have yet to take it (I'm a junior) but I plan to next year. Many of the companies I spoke to at the career fair also asked about the course so it seems like it's a good one to take. I have friends that took it that also say great things about it. Though I don't know if it would fit your "not too hard" requirement.

My advice would be to take parallel. You can always learn android for fun on your own. Which is pretty much what the class is anyway...

It's not difficult, but there are weekly assignments and a large final project. I enjoyed it a lot. It's more fun than difficult. If you like making programs with java, this is for you. Joanne is a very good professor because she has a lot of structure and is very welcoming with office hours. Some people don't like the fact that her lectures are slow, but all you have to do is be there. 

Parallel is much more difficult. I dropped it once at the drop deadline and took it a year later. It teaches more abstract concepts and introduces you to some very advanced stuff. I didn't like it too much because Amazon Web Services was the devil. I did manage to teach myself python in a weekend, which was cool. This is more student-driven than UI. If you have motivation and focus, you can do very well in this class.

Take this with a grain of salt because I liked UI much more than Parallel. I took Automata with Algorithms. Those two classes sort of went hand in hand.</commentText><authorName>BagsOfMoney</authorName><authorID>51s5f</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1pqfv1<comments><comment><commentCreated>1383396668.0</commentCreated><commentID>cd4xp4j</commentID><commentText>Solid turnout.

The professor assigned every name on the roster a number, and then used one of those old bingo ball rollers to choose a few people each day to call on when no one was participating.  Some days groups would get extra focus, if you were missing from your group on the group's day, it will hurt your grade.  They also made a note of who was there to pick up papers when they were handed back, as well as one or two other handouts.  If you have a habit of skipping class, you're taking a gamble on whether or not it'll be noticed, and it can make you lose an easy A.  </commentText><authorName>Jernon</authorName><authorID>48r1w</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1383437707.0</commentCreated><commentID>cd553t7</commentID><commentText>ha. workload is non existent.

I've made incredible friends, have great stories and will genuinely miss this place after grad in May.

Ask me in a few days when I have two problem sets, a research paper to write, a test in 3 out of 4 classes and my eyes are permanently bloodshot from lack of sleep and I will tell you that this school sucks.  It's too competitive, the profs have unrealistic expectations and I wish I'd never gone here and that not choosing my state school was a huge mistake. And why does Baltimore weather suck? 

And then the crush will be over, it'll be a beautiful day and I'll find myself getting misty thinking about leaving.  JHU and I have a love hate relationship.  In the end, it's made me a hard worker, a little neurotic about deadlines, damn good at math (relatively) and even better at staring problems (both problem sets and personal) in the face and knowing I can work through them.

Most of the classes in the math department are taught by recent PhDs with short term positions at the university.  Castello on the other hand is a part of the applied math faculty.

Those two courses are fundamentally set up differently.  Lin Alg in the math department should give you a full spectrum conceptual understanding of linear systems as well vector spaces and their properties.  LA/DE is kind of quick and dirty of what you are going to need to know to solve some real world problems and it's kind of like the highlights of both topics.  I think some of the more subtle points are kind of swept under the rug.  It totally depends on what you want to do with your life.  I would personally choose the full on lin alg course because IMO linear algebra is like the single most important college math class and having a solid understanding of it is pretty important.  </commentText><authorName>kittycatcate</authorName><authorID>4z9ql</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1383098517.0</commentCreated><commentID>cd29img</commentID><commentText> Castello was great when I had her for discrete.

The two disciplines are in different schools (Applied Math is in Engineering and Economics is in A&amp;S) so there's not much overlap between the majors. I'll cover both separately. 

The Economics department here is quite good in a lot of ways, and I have enjoyed my time here. You will begin your first year taking either Elements of Micro with Professor Hamilton or both Elements of Macro and Elements of Micro if you did not take AP Macro (I am not sure who teaches the Elements of Macro course as it changes yearly, Maccini taught the course for many years but he recently stepped down from teaching). Professor Hamilton's course is fairly notorious for being difficult, but I found it a good intro to the economics department and economics in general. It should be a course that helps to gauge whether you want to continue with Economics. Additionally, you can also take Intermediate Macro alongside Elements of Micro if you feel you are sufficiently prepared (so you can jump ahead a semester- Elements of Macro is offered in the fall and Elements of Micro is offered in the spring, but Intermediate Micro is in the fall and Intermediate Macro is in the spring). 

After the elements course you will have your two intermediate courses and will also be able to take about half of the elective courses in the department (you really can't do much until you get Elements of Micro / Macro done except possibly some 200 level courses). The intermediate courses include calculus based problems and are more rigorous classes for Sophomores / Juniors. I would say most economics majors complete both the classes Sophomore year (fall and spring). 

Once the elements and intermediate sequences are done you have Econometrics and about five elective courses left (these elective courses can be taken alongside the core courses so you can be pretty much done with all the elective requirements by junior year if you want to be). Econometrics is basically applying statistical analysis to economics and is important for research and the like. If you squeeze your schedule it's relatively easy to complete all the undergraduate economics requirements by first semester of Junior year. This leaves a lot of time left, and it really depends on what your goals are for what you do after.

A lot of the students in economics are interested in banking / finance / business. JHU (like many other top 20 schools) doesn't have an undergraduate business program and so a lot of students use economics as a sort of surrogate business major. If your goal is specifically finance / banking / something not super quant heavy then I would suggest pairing economics with another social science major like international studies. Economics / international studies is generally easier for students than economics and math or applied math would be (and your cumulative GPA is a fairly important factor in getting jobs, less so for graduate school as performance in specific courses matters), but do what you enjoy.

If you want to do go further in economics (research or graduate studies for example, as it sounds like you do) then you can also do that. You can begin taking graduate classes as early as you are ready. The earliest you would probably do this is second semester of Junior year, but most probably senior year. All graduate courses are open to undergraduates who are sufficiently prepared, so you can continue on with economics as far as you would like. Taking upper levels undergraduate / graduate courses may be important for graduate school admissions if that is your thing. 
 
As for research, there's unfortunately not a whole lot you can do your early years. Economics is not like hard sciences where you can work in a lab and easily help out. Most research opportunities are for students who have at least completed econometrics (so at least junior year) and who have some additional math / economics background and know the professor. I wouldn't count on being able to do much research (especially early on) but graduate schools know this and take it into account. You will most likely be doing data collection or something similar for a professor if they needed any help. However, the department is hiring quite a few young professors so this may change a bit as it expands. Additionally, there is the option of doing a senior thesis which will allow you to get some research under your belt before you graduate. There are quite a few outside research options during the summer / breaks also. 

As for the fields you mentioned, you really won't be able to specialize early on as that happens mostly in graduate work. There are elective courses in the department on game theory, and microeconomic theory is covered in elements / intermediate / graduate courses. Really the important thing in economics is taking as many classes as you can (and doing well in them), getting to know the professors, and being on the look out for research opportunities when they present themselves. 

As for Applied Math, I am a lot less active in the department as I enjoy economics more, but doing Math is pretty much necessary for graduate school. (I would personally do Applied Math over pure Math if you had no prior preferences and graduate school was your only goal.) You will be taking all the usual required classes such as Calculus 1,2, and 3, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Probability, Statistics, Optimization, etc. The optimization course in the department is pretty popular (as you mentioned you are interested in that). Also, there are some computational economics / finance classes that can be interesting and helpful. I know the Applied Math department also has opportunities for undergraduate research but again I'm not too involved there. 

In sum, Economics / Math is fairly straightforward, especially if you want to do graduate studies. Both departments are strong and have plenty of opportunities to go as far as you need or desire to. PM me if you have any questions (I also know of a few economics research programs outside of JHU if you are interested in those).

If one was willing to face the possibility of death. I don't recommend that one do this. 

Anyway, as you probably know there is a door in room 400 in Gilman that goes to the clocktower. It is also locked all the time. If you would really like to go on the tower though, do this:

Go to room 400. It gets locked at 9 (10?) so either prop it or open or go beforehand. 

Go up the spiral staircase to the window on the left if you're facing the library. 

The window is (was) open, so open it. You're now faced with quite a steep roof. 

If you really want to risk it, one could climb out of the window onto the roof. Slowly, and make sure you have as much surface contact as possible. Wear grippy shoes. 

Bring two friends. I suppose you could increase safety by bringing a rope and being clever with it. 

Once you're at the fold of the roof, climb over to behind the tower. With the two friends you brought, boost someone up to the Balcony. 

Once on the balcony, the person can enter through the door there (in front, not locked) and open the door that is in Gilman 400. 

That means that two people have to go back down the roof, a very scary and dangerous proposition. Once you've crawled back in through the window, your buddy can let you in through the Gilman door and you can check out the clocktower. It's beautiful. 

Again, DON'T DO THIS IT IS NOT WORTH IT. But you can impress some girls with a great story. </commentText><authorName>GilmanGuy12</authorName><authorID>d8u3y</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1379565244.0</commentCreated><commentID>ccazc76</commentID><commentText>You can also get into the Amr 1 entrance pretty easily with a credit card or similar, it's one if the few sites on casks that can be picked that way.</commentText><authorName>Yawehg</authorName><authorID>6nksr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1381295678.0</commentCreated><commentID>ccnq4wx</commentID><commentText>So the best way is to try from Remsen?</commentText><authorName>normandesmond</authorName><authorID>7hp5h</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1380152804.0</commentCreated><commentID>ccf5f29</commentID><commentText>Any update OP?

Check the light rail schedule when deciding which JHMI shuttle to catch, as service from Penn Station isn't as frequent as service on the mainline. Remember to factor in a couple minutes for everyone to buy their light rail tickets.

I suggest getting day passes instead of paying per-ride. They're only 30 cents more than a round trip, and then you get to skip the ticket line on the way back, and you can take a 3 or 11 bus from Penn Station back to campus (if you get there in a gap between JHMI shuttles and don't feel like waiting) without paying extra.</commentText><authorName>jstump91</authorName><authorID>3b28e</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1378860069.0</commentCreated><commentID>cc5kciv</commentID><commentText>I agree with the suggestions to take light rail.

It's a spring class, and I'm not sure if the professor is even coming back next year however. But you have opinion writing assignments every week.  Most of the time you get to choose what you write about. There's enough extra credit to cover half the semester's assignments. You write your opinion on current events, reviews on movies, books, and other things of your choice. Also there are 4 or 5 movie days, where in class we just watched movies :D Super easy-A class, as long as you make sure you do enough assignments by the end of the semester. 

Even if you don't like writing, seriously, it's so easy to write your own opinion. You can't be wrong anyway, and the only points he takes off are for grammar. 

Edit: Oh yeah, its pretty hard to get into online, but if you go to the Writing Sems office you can add it easily with a paper slip.</commentText><authorName>Sgt_Ice_Bucket</authorName><authorID>4tg7p</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1378173132.0</commentCreated><commentID>cc0bp5s</commentID><commentText>Creative Improvisation, if you can get into it</commentText><authorName>curlymeatball38</authorName><authorID>4szgs</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1378265658.0</commentCreated><commentID>cc11rps</commentID><commentText>Stagecraft.

I realize that it is a grammatically correct sentence.  But it feels like there's a word missing between "how" and "Johns".  Like, "how great Johns Hopkins truly is", or "how pretty Johns Hopkins truly is".   Maybe "what Johns Hopkins is truly like" would be nicer.

However, Baltimore is definitely a dangerous city, and what I don't understand is why Hopkins does not have a legitimate police force. Before grad school at JHU, I did my undergrad at Carnegie Mellon---which is in a safe area of Pittsburgh---and they had their own state sanctioned police force. Officers, detectives, jail cells, guns, etc. 

It baffles me that JHU doesn't do the same. Baltimore city police are underfunded and have much better things to do than be a JHU police presence. How often in those security bulletins does it say "Baltimore police arrived and search the scene with negative results"---how much crime might be deterred if there was a full time police presence just for JHU, and then how much quicker could they respond to events if they were stationed locally and only dealt with the JHU areas. </commentText><authorName>DrGar</authorName><authorID>cy6o9</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1378376809.0</commentCreated><commentID>cc1yyfr</commentID><commentText>I've been at JHU for 5 years now (PhD in Psychology) and I've never been mugged.

Getting mugged or attacked is never your fault, but you can certainly do a lot to lessen your chances. Don't walk around on your phone. Don't walk around with headphones in. Be alert, and look actively alert. These students getting mugged was a bad situation, and they were in a group, but these attacks happen because Hopkins students are easy pickings. We walk around carrying expensive things, often not behaving like we live in a city.

The course itself wasn't all that difficult. It was a standard 100 level workload. Mostly memorization. We had 3 midterms, all of which were weighted fairly equally. The only thing that took up more than 20 minutes of my time was essays. She assigned 2 or 3 two page reflections on topics that she covered in the course. They were pretty easy to do and they weren't graded that hard. Bottom line? Do the reading and make sure you study and you'll do fine. However, regardless of the work, Dr. Feigenson is a phenomenal lecturer. Hands down one of the best that I had in my time at school. She lectures off Powerpoint so it's pretty easy to follow and you can tell she loves what she does.

Both of them have similar personalities in that they're funny, bubbly people who genuinely love what they do. 

Their class can be a bit finicky--you have lectures that are largely memorization, but there's also the sections where you have a TA lecturing as well, and those generally aren't as interesting because they demonstrate for you various psych experiments, but with you as the subject. It sounds interesting on the face of it but it's pretty hit and miss. 

Still, not a bad class!

It took me completely off guard. You'd think that at a school like Hopkins, industry leaders in biotech would be swarming all over us. For the biomedical engineering department at least, this is not true. The program is very strongly, and almost certainly intentionally, designed to help you get into graduate school. 

I don't what the situation is for other engineering majors, and it's quite possible that their situation is very different from ours so I'm hoping others will chime in here.

Mostly interesting classes, mostly good professors, challenging but not impossible work, everything has been good. We have a fairly active ACM chapter that hosts weekly presentations from grad students and professors, and this year we're having our first JHU hackathon in September.

As for machine learning, you could peruse their website: http://ml.jhu.edu/

I haven't taken any of those classes yet, but the faculty that I know are all cool and quite good teachers. I don't really know anything about AI here, we do have classes in it and I've heard they're quite challenging.

The math classes I've taken have been pretty good and my applied math friends seem to be enjoying their experience, but I don't know much more than that.

As for on-campus recruiting, it doesn't seem to be as big as I've heard it is at other schools. There is a career fair every year, and you can take a look at who's attending this year: https://jhu-csm.symplicity.com/events/students.php?_so_list_from29ff2b3472290080aa456617a0dc22a0=0&amp;_so_list_from29ff2b3472290080aa456617a0dc22a0_page=1

Certainly a lot of places a CS major might be interested in working. I have to say I'm not sure how useful the fair is, I've been able to get solid internships through other methods and I haven't invested a lot of time in career fairs or that kind of thing.

As for individual companies coming to recruit, it doesn't seem to be a big thing here. Microsoft came this year, there were probably others but there weren't a ton.

One thing we do get that I think is somewhat unique to the CS department: a LOT of emails about startups looking for CS people. Sometimes some former JHU students started a company, sometimes it's a company in the Baltimore area. If it isn't a startup it's usually a temporary position, like "we need someone to help build our Android app or upgrade our database this summer" or something like that. I feel like I get at least one of these emails every week.

So there certainly is some recruiting, but I haven't felt a significant presence from big companies.

Oh one more thing, the career center is very helpful, and we do get access to some kind of sort-of-exclusive internship database. Exclusive to Hopkins or some network Hopkins is part of, I think. So depending on where you want to work you might find some good connections through that.</commentText><authorName>bobtheterminator</authorName><authorID>6jypy</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1377164594.0</commentCreated><commentID>cbspmqh</commentID><commentText>For Computer Science, I know people at Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon.  I don't know how much say they have in hiring (they're new in the last couple years), and those are just some of the big companies.  A few people go to them every year (not so much Apple, but I think that's because people don't want to as much).  I don't think I know anyone that looked for a job and couldn't find one somewhere.  Others go to local or smaller companies.  Of course, we're close to D.C. and the associated bunch of defense contractors who always say they're hiring, but I don't know anyone who has tried to go there.  When Microsoft came recruiting this year (with food!), I knew 2/3 of the employees they brought along.  There's a bunch of recruiting events in addition to the career fairs each semester.  There's been more interest here in the last couple years in startups and such, but we're not too good at those yet.  I have come across some JHU people in open source projects.

Natural Language Processing is pretty big here (at least in CS).  The class is indisputably on the list of the couple "hardest and most rewarding classes."  Last year, the department hired a new ML professor; I don't recall if their looking for another one; there are already some.  This isn't my area of interest, so I don't know much about the faculty here.  There's a few classes, including a new one last year.  A lot of people will double major CS &amp; AMS.  Also not my area of interest.

I think an above-average number of CS students here do grad school, but it is by no means dominant.  I don't know what the perception of JHU from industry is, though we get tons of swag at the career fair.</commentText><authorName>todayman</authorName><authorID>4rcjr</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1387475948.0</commentCreated><commentID>ce5fr6q</commentID><commentText>Applied math grad student here. if you are still interested I can say a few things</commentText><authorName>adalisan</authorName><authorID>b34w5</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1jbbty<comments><comment><commentCreated>1375175454.0</commentCreated><commentID>cbczabk</commentID><commentText>Thank you for stealing so many hours from my life.

I certainly know people here with lower stats than yours, and Hopkins certainly does not seem to go for straight stats alone, and there are certainly people  here who are neither social or athletic (although the fact that you are seeking help already sets you a bit above them as is). Seek more APs if you can, but it's not required or anything. You probably stand a pretty decent chance of getting in (no promises though!)

I would say to try and involve yourself in more things at school if you can--it doesn't have to be straight through school. For instance, some people contacted places like old folks homes, hospitals, and places like that of their own volition and became a volunteer there, or got a job somewhere, anything along those lines. 

As for the SAT, know that it definitely rarely goes according to plan--I got a 233 on the PSAT, but on each SAT I took I got around 2200. However, combined I pulled a 2370, and I would *definitely* take advantage of the fact that you can do this because no other standardized test will ever be like that again in your life. Take it as many times as you need to!</commentText><authorName>Halefire</authorName><authorID>5z1qx</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1373922712.0</commentCreated><commentID>cb30c75</commentID><commentText>I think that a general misconception about college admissions is that SATs and GPAs matter; while this is true for outliers in the spectrum, overall I'd say that a more important part of getting into where you want to go is differentiating yourself from everyone else.

What makes you special? Can you eat 50 hotdogs in one sitting? Are you the world champion tooth-pick-tower builder? Remember that time you saved a penguin's life by performing CPR? What do you do in your free time?

Admissions officers see 50 candidates who are essentially the same on paper all the time. How one gets chosen over the others is dependent on who the officer thinks will add the most to the school. Colleges want their campuses to be filled with smart, interesting people. What makes you stand out?

Spend a lot of time on your essay, and write about things about your life that make you interesting or that have shaped you as a person; any experiences, anything like that.

2.) Absolutely get an admissions interview. Practice how to interview beforehand. Don't be nervous; carry on conversation, but don't talk the whole time either. I'm not the greatest at interviewing so I can't give much advice on how to approach it, but definitely do an admissions interview.

3.) Apply early decision. Acceptance rate early decision is somewhere around 35% higher than regular admission.

4.) Take the SAT (or ACT) as soon as possible, then take it again if you didn't do exceptionally. Give yourself as many opportunities to take it as possible.

My school didn't offer many clubs either, so that kinda sucked. I volunteered at a hospital and did Big Brother, Big Sister. I was also captain of my lacrosse team, but I don't think they'd care too much about high school sports if you're not attending for sports.

tl;dr Do the best you can with what you have, and spend time on interviews/applications so that they are actually decent.</commentText><authorName>CrypticParagon</authorName><authorID>8qq4c</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1i43sb<comments><comment><commentCreated>1373617767.0</commentCreated><commentID>cb0udkb</commentID><commentText>do it!</commentText><authorName>hopelepoh</authorName><authorID>9vxtm</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1374842644.0</commentCreated><commentID>cbaj5an</commentID><commentText>if you can't get a good grade in it, you don't deserve to be at hop</commentText><authorName>alee103</authorName><authorID>8md8p</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1i1wk7<comments><comment><commentCreated>1373539063.0</commentCreated><commentID>cb05rvd</commentID><commentText>One year I got significantly lower, and it was a mistake that they corrected.

Essentially, because of complaints from a fair number of members who, for various reasons, needed gender specific swimming.  In as much of a pc way as possible, we had to extend the gender specificness to both genders for an equal amount of time.  Pretty much, we didn't want specific members to be excluded from being able to use the pool for personal modesty reasons, so the only way to equal it out was to make it the way it now is. Now, I don't know if this is extending into the school year, and if so, to what extent, but for now they made it this way.  I would personally say no, anyone can swim when they want, and if you don't like it then too bad, don't let five of you ruin it for the approximately 1,500 or so members who enter the facility on any given day, but then again I don't make those decisions, and as a private school and health club they are free to make their own rules.

TL;DR People complained needing it, couldn't give it to one gender only, gave it to both.

The following is based on what's available in the fall, and none have pre-requisites.

Intro to Greek Philosophy with Richard Bett is a pretty good course and will give you good background on Plato, Aristotle, and the Pre-Socratics. Workload is manageable (three 6-page papers and a final, no midterm) and he's a good lecturer. 

Intro to Bioethics, which I took with another professor, is a pretty fun class. From what I hear Hilary Bok is a good professor (and her dad used to be president of Harvard).

Philosophy of Religion with Steve Gross is a really interesting class, which I didn't enjoy as much because my TA sucked. The readings are pretty dense but if you have an interest in theology it's a fun class. Just be aware that it is **not** learning about the specifics of various religions; it's about philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God. Workload is very manageable (three medium-length papers and a final).

Ethics and History of Human Experimentation with Dan O'Connor is one of the best classes I've taken at Hopkins, and I highly suggest you take it. There are also 10 spots left and I highly doubt they'll be snapped up before you register. It's upper-level, and you have to write two longer papers and there are a ton of readings, but it requres only minimal background in philosophy. You'll learn about the Stanford prison experiment, MK-Ultra, how medical trials are run, etc. 

Hope this helps!</commentText><authorName>ac91</authorName><authorID>658hi</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1369798207.0</commentCreated><commentID>ca7mn1a</commentID><commentText>Can't you take Chem and Bio freshmen year?

Freshman year, the preppy and nerdy people will be pretty much evenly distributed, with the exception of Wolman. Lacrosse players (and many other athletes) house in Wolman, so it can get pretty noisy there.

There are tons of different types of people in every dorm. I don't think certain personalities go with certain dorms and there isn't a "typical" person in any four of the main freshman buildings. It's just that the physical layout of the AMRs makes it more conducive to hanging out with people on your floor and in your house.  </commentText><authorName>TPaine16</authorName><authorID>4iugk</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1369244642.0</commentCreated><commentID>ca3nafx</commentID><commentText>I'm pretty introverted and I had a great time in the AMRs.

I didn't live in the AMRs my first year, I lived in the "antisocial" Building A/B. If I could go back and pick again, I'd still pick Building A/B. I didn't think it was difficult at all to meet people living in a different building, and its not like the person you live with/near your first year will be your best friend. As a senior next year, I'm currently living with no one I lived with or even near my first year, mostly because I realized I had more interests with other people. 

I know this a very indirect answer, so fuck it here's what I'm trying to say. Yes, you can always hide away in your room anywhere if you want in any building. Yes, more people live in AMRs than any other, but if you don't pick others you will meet people/make friends. Everyone is coming in in the same situation knowing no one else. Honestly I met most of the people I know at parties/ffc.

You'll be spending a lot of time in the halls, sitting and doing homework with the other people in your house, especially in AMR II. In AMR I there are also common rooms (for example, Sylvester) that people hang out in often. And a lot of people leave their doors open, so when you get closer to people you'll be able to just walk in and hang out with them. 

Of course, you can always close your door, if you're looking for alone time.</commentText><authorName>kayjay734</authorName><authorID>9vdmi</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1369107484.0</commentCreated><commentID>ca2iq4w</commentID><commentText>I'm an introvert, and I lived in AMR II. I was actually happier with my housing experience that year than the next year when I lived in a CC double with someone even quieter and more introverted than me.

I made an agreement with my roommate that there would be no drinking parties in our room and bought earplugs and I was fine. I really liked the low barrier to social interaction and had privacy and quiet when I wanted it.

The dorms have different personalities each year as a result of who lives there, so while there tends to be a distinction between them in a given year, it's not consistent across years.

Figure out what you need to do to get along with your roommate (if you have one) and you'll be fine.</commentText><authorName>rpglover64</authorName><authorID>4a1gd</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1369082282.0</commentCreated><commentID>ca2aymf</commentID><commentText>It's Hopkins, isn't it?</commentText><authorName>MarleyandtheWhalers</authorName><authorID>6sdnr</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1ek3w7<comments><comment><commentCreated>1368876764.0</commentCreated><commentID>ca10fi7</commentID><commentText>Done with JHU forever! </commentText><authorName>Gulagman</authorName><authorID>58qvp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1368946182.0</commentCreated><commentID>ca1epj1</commentID><commentText>Bruce Hamilton is the worst.</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1egnot<comments><comment><commentCreated>1368755619.0</commentCreated><commentID>ca01cs3</commentID><commentText>It will get more traffic especially checking for parties in the fall</commentText><authorName>noteberry</authorName><authorID>7c6li</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1ee739<comments><comment><commentCreated>1368706590.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9zpzxy</commentID><commentText>Graphic designer here.

The transition for me has been interesting. I transferred from a small liberal arts college very far from JHU in the middle of nowhere. The atmosphere at my old college was completely different. There was a very tight student body, the professors were 100% focused on undergrads and not research, and the administration was very laid back, responsive, and friendly. So, take all this into account when reading my comment. I have also visited nearly every single top tier school in the US and I think I have a pretty good sense of the pros and cons of most major universities in this country. Anyways, coming to Baltimore was quite a transition for me. After experiencing JHU, here's what I'd have to say:

The Cons:

1. I don't think there is much of a student community here or a lot of expressed school pride. Most people seem content in their own worlds, doing their own things with their group of friends, and pursuing their own goals.

2. The surrounding area isn't great (and sometimes kind of unsafe) but it is getting better. Plus, I think JHU has a pretty good security force. In terms of things to do, there isn't a whole lot outside of a few bars. But, the harbor is relatively nearby and Towson/Loyola are just up the road. 

3. The administration and the professors can be somewhat distant. There is more of a focus on research over undergrads. There are always exceptions to this, but in my view there is a huge emphasis on personal responsibility. YOU have to go out and seek opportunities and meet people and make sure you get good grades. No one is going to look after your shoulder or hand you things. Sometimes you might have to be a bit pushy yourself.

The Pros

1. The students and professors here are all very smart people. I have met some of the smartest people I've ever known in my life. Of course there are slackers and "how-did-they-even-get-into-this-college" types of people at every school. But in general, I can be confident that whoever I'm talking to is a smart person with interesting ideas. The professors are also often world-class and have a wealth of knowledge (although some of them can be kind of socially awkward and/or boring)

2. JHU is very diverse. My old college was extremely homogenous (maybe even a bit prejudiced). Here, I've met students from all over the world with so many different backgrounds. There's a good amount of racial integration in social groups as well. Plus, contrary to what people may say, I think people here are pretty friendly and not too cutthroat.

3. JHU has so many opportunities and resources. It's location isn't bad (it's THE university in Baltimore with schools all over the city). It's a quick train ride from DC (where there are even more schools). And it provides so many academic programs, research opportunities, networking opportunities, etc etc. 

When I got accepted into JHU, I was beyond elated. Yes, coming here was a huge transition and there was a tradeoff of pros and cons. But, I don't regret my decision. You currently attend a large state college and so you might actually find JHU to be a warm and tight-knit environment - who knows. I was also attracted to JHU for its academics, and I have not been disappointed. 

As for application advice, I'm not really sure. I was a good student but I wasn't anything spectacular (I definitely did not have a 3.9, although I did make Dean's List every semester). I was active in a small handful of ECs, but I didn't have any leadership positions. I think what really helped were 1. my grades, 2. my essays, and 3. my professors' recommendations. My transcript showed an upward trend in grades and difficulty in classes, and I got to know my professors very well and they felt comfortable in writing me solid recommendations. The important thing for the essay is to never outright bash your old college. Always focus on the positives and the potential improvements. For example, instead of saying "X University has had poor academic opportunities", say "X University has provided many academic opportunities for me. However I believe that JHU will better provide me with the resources that I need." Bad writing but you get my point. Don't sound like you're bitter or that you dislike your college. State that you've appreciated and learned from the experience you had, but you're seeking something more. Also, add specifics. Show that you know about the college and what you want to gain from going there. Don't make your essay sound generic. A good test is if you take out the word JHU in your essay, can you still tell that it's about JHU and not just about any other college? Writing a transfer essay can be 10x harder than writing just a normal application essay in high school. It's especially hard since there aren't any real guides for transfer apps. You're kinda on your own if you want to transfer.

Historically, the transfer rate to JHU has been atrociously low (less than 5%) and because of that, JHU isn't the most transfer friendly school. But, you seem to be in better shape than I was when I applied. Maintaining a good college record is difficult and will put you leagues ahead of the crowd when applying. Sorry for the long post, but I hope it helped. I hope to see you on campus soon!</commentText><authorName>townhouse45</authorName><authorID>blomc</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1367898960.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9tlx35</commentID><commentText>Quoted from an admissions officer [here](http://forums.hopkins-interactive.com/topic/6647152/1/),  

&gt;"The Biomedical Engineering program at Johns Hopkins University is a limited enrollment major. Since the program is designed to be a four year program, it is extremely competitive to transfer directly into the BME program at Hopkins. In the last few years no transfer applicants have been offered admission into the BME major and that trend is expected to continue in the future."  

&gt;"If space ever opens up in the BME program (and that is an extremely rare occurrence that hasn't happened in the past three years) those spots would be filled by currently enrolled freshmen engineering students, not transfer students. Simply put, transfer students applying to Hopkins should not consider BME as an option. "

That being said, research labs tend to not really care what major you are, as you generally won't know much about their research going into it so they teach you what you need to know over time (for example, I work in a lab that's VERY multidisciplinary, and has MechE's and BME's and CompSci majors). So maybe look for research that interests you, see what department it is in, and if it happens to not be in BME, you're in luck!  

And just in general, I'd really recommend you try looking into alternative paths to BME, but if you are DIE-HARD, VERY SET ON IT, then it is somewhat sometimes feasible to hop into BME your sophomore year. It's very difficult though. One kid I know who did so is an absolutely exemplary student, and was enrolled in an equally as difficult program prior to switching to BME. He actually wasn't allowed to switch, but he just started taking all of the BME-required classes and sort of brute forcing his way into the program, and by junior year when he demonstrated to the department head that not only was he on track for BME requirements, but was also doing very well academically, they finally gave him the go-ahead to officially switch into the department. </commentText><authorName>sushislushie</authorName><authorID>6426n</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1367900001.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9tmb46</commentID><commentText>Like sushislushie said, it would be very difficult to transfer as a BME. Another thing is looking at other engineering departments' and the concentrations they offer. In MechE, there is a biomechanics concentration, Materials Science has a biomaterials track, and other departments offer similar options. Granted, you have to major in that field to get the concentration, but I'm sure you could take classes from another department to satisfy the engineering elective requirements.

And research in BME without being a BME is definitely an option. Labs here really emphasize cross-disciplinary collaboration.</commentText><authorName>ameriswissy</authorName><authorID>6sqcp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1367898179.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9tlmq5</commentID><commentText>[deleted]</commentText><authorID>none</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1dpiiz<comments><comment><commentCreated>1367752648.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9sm3zk</commentID><commentText>Beautiful Dangus?

1) The FFC - Yea, it still sucks. I know a new company is taking over, but there are some things that can be quickly changed for next years freshman. First, the ice cream machine. Why do we need an employee operating that. Half of the time, no ones there. Do what most normal colleges do, and let the students make their own ice cream. Hopkins is the only college I know which doesn't do this. Also, just look at the serving dishes they use. It looks like they're trying to feed 50 people instead of 500. Its embarrassing when I go there and there's almost nothing available. There should ALWAYS be pizza, pasta, and hamburgers. They're easy to make quickly. Also, have the burgers pre-made. It's just easier for everyone.

2) The bathrooms - I should never walk in and see no toilet paper or paper towels. There are days at a time without toilet paper and I have to walk and find some. This is bullshit.

3) The AMR common lounge - I'm not 12 years old. I can operate a remote and don't need someone to hand it to me. Why the heck are the remotes locked in a cabinet. The same goes for the pool sticks and balls. What's the point of having this stuff if its only available for like 5 hours a day.

4) A database of clubs and their meeting places and times. There's some of it online now, but most of it is out-of-date.

5) The Navy-Hopkins tailgate thing was awesome and a huge success. Throw a few more of those in. Maybe not with all the things like sunglasses and shirts, but even just the food and music.

6) There are rats in the ceilings of the AMRs. Deal with this.

7) To increase event attendance, have a rewards program (? Idk if this is would work tho). Go to all the lacrosse games, get a tee shirt or something.

8) Food + library = good. I don't mean eating in the actual library, but maybe having something like a Meals in Minutes located in the library. I know that the Cafe is there, but its expensive as hell and its only open till 12.

That's all I can think of now, I'll edit if I think of more.

I hope I didn't come off as hating Hopkins, as I really like it, but I think the experience can be made much better for next years Freshman class.</commentText><authorName>randompikachu</authorName><authorID>8fvmc</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1cxzsa<comments><comment><commentCreated>1366776989.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9l64wu</commentID><commentText>Not surprised in the slightest.

I don't smoke, nor do I even like it when people do so, but I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't be regulating things like that.  Work harder on providing resources for people to quit, don't just immediately resort to an all out ban.  I spent last summer on a smoke-free campus.  Not only did it achieve nothing, it made the smokers more agitated with walking out some distance into the heat to smoke, and there was a literal white and orange line from discarded cigarette butts that divided the part of campus where I was living and off-campus property.  Granted, that's not indicative that things will be that bad here, but I thought it was a pretty good illustration of how abysmally an idea like this could fail.  </commentText><authorName>Jernon</authorName><authorID>48r1w</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1366766365.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9l1xhw</commentID><commentText>Yeah the facebook craziness that went on a few days before the vote was apparently not at all indicative of the majority point of view.

I can say that, while you may be aware of us when we smoke, we're more aware of you (you being anyone walking by).  I'm incredibly self-conscious when I smoke- not only at the stigma/snap judgements that come with people seeing you smoke, but I was also always worried I'll see one of my professors or the like.  That being said, when I did smoke on campus, I would take care to not walk near people, ESPECIALLY kids.  When I would smoke outside of the library, which was also pretty rare, I would walk until I was a good bit away from people.

That in of itself is impinging on the freedoms of those who want to remain smoke-free. They're not trying to prevent smoking altogether (or at least that shouldn't be the angle they should be approaching with), they're trying to force smoking to be in specific places (i.e. off campus).

All that being said, the majority of people on campus aren't smokers--if you ask them "would you like smoking to be banned from campus", it's not really much of a stretch to think they'd think for a second or two, vote yes, then move on.</commentText><authorName>Halefire</authorName><authorID>5z1qx</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1366770218.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9l3eyo</commentID><commentText>was actually talking to some people at CHEW the other day that are in charge of HKB (not about this, I was there for something unrelated) but it was mentioned in passing and they made a comment about how they're really pushing for the ban because they don't want Hopkins to be among the last college campuses to implement the ban. So apparently it's a thing at other schools. But I don't know, we do have a campus but also we're in a city...the people who do smoke do it in pretty isolated places anyway so it doesn't even seem like a ban is necessary. I voted no on the smoking ban referral, if only because I think it's unfair to the few smokers on campus that actually do try to be courteous of where they smoke.

Smoking any tobacco products will be prohibited on all Johns Hopkins University property, which includes all University buildings, facilities, and University vehicles. Students, faculty, staff, and visitors will be expected to adhere to this policy. The sale and distribution of tobacco products on the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus will also be prohibited, as will the promotion or sponsorship of such products. Smoking cessation support from the Student Health and Wellness Center and the Center for Health Education and Wellness will be available to all students interested in quitting. Support will also be provided to faculty and staff.

Craigslist is also another option, but I'm not sure how effective it would be.</commentText><authorName>Yogur</authorName><authorID>5kuvm</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1365768939.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9dk3c2</commentID><commentText>[Here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/206743736105967/?bookmark_t=group) is a group where people post listings like that.

I agree with those saying it really never feels like Hopkins cares about the undergraduate population.

I've tried so hard to love and support JHU these past 4 years but I can strongly say I am not planning on any alumni donations in the future. The amount of effort we see is just insulting. 

I am so sick of everything being focused on medicine. I'm not in the medical school and i've made it as clear as I can that it is not my interest, yet Hopkins insists on shoving it down my throat at any chance they get.</commentText><authorName>Sgt_Ice_Bucket</authorName><authorID>4tg7p</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1365728558.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9d4jxm</commentID><commentText>[Administrators just don't understand!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW3PFC86UNI)</commentText><authorName>bonacbluejay</authorName><authorID>5wraa</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1365720473.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9d1jc0</commentID><commentText>Given that for one terror-filled day I thought our commencement speaker was to be Rick "Science-man" Santorum, I can get in line with this quite enthusiastically.

Edit: maybe it's worth clarifying that I mean this *relative* to the Science-man there. I'm certainly not happy that it's someone who has already told his story twice on campus already, and is about to tell it a third time.</commentText><authorName>Halefire</authorName><authorID>5z1qx</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1365731305.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9d5lyg</commentID><commentText>Here's a [blog](http://ndepaulmusings.tumblr.com/post/47704889134/johns-hopkins-commencement-fail) article about it.</commentText><authorName>Gulagman</authorName><authorID>58qvp</authorID></comment><comment><commentCreated>1365742081.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9da05s</commentID><commentText>Wow, sorry seniors. </commentText><authorName>shinygiraffes</authorName><authorID>987b3</authorID></comment></comments></submission><submission>1c1lwf<comments><comment><commentCreated>1365654767.0</commentCreated><commentID>c9cjt2q</commentID><commentText>Don't worry, I'm sure someone's already planning on starting Voice for Choice.

Looks like you have to request it, they don't automatically give you a refund.
