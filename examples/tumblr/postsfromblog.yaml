      \ and students were hired to do some assessments for several manmade and natural\
      \ ponds on his property. He wanted to maintain them with several different fish\
      \ populations so that kids nearby could fish and have a good time. </p>\n<p>While\
      \ we were working he rode up in his four wheeler with a terrified look on his\
      \ face. I never thought I would see a former football player on the verge of\
      \ tears, but boy howdy he nearly was. Several of us stop what we were doing\
      \ and go over to see what was up. </p>\n<p>\u201CI was running the tractor through\
      \ the field and almost hit a fawn.\u201D He says.</p>\n<p>Now, for reference,\
      \ it\u2019s pretty common to have farmers run over and kill fawns. The defense\
      \ mechanism of fawns when they are young is to lay down low and not move\u2026\
      which obviously isn\u2019t great for when there\u2019s a tractor. It happens\
      \ all the time, but it can be pretty bloody. It\u2019s not a pretty sight.</p>\n\
      <p>So, thinking that maybe such a gory scene unnerved him and that we may have\
      \ to dispose of the body, I say \u201CMr. Brown, is the fawn still alive?\u201D\
      \ </p>\n<p>He says \u201CYes, I took it to the barn\u2026but I\u2019m afraid\
      \ the mom won\u2019t take it back because it has human scent on it.\u201D</p>\n\
      <p>The myth about \u201Chuman scent\u201D is a common one, but it\u2019s just\
      \ that\u2026a myth. But still, this guy was absolutely terrified that this little\
      \ deer was going to live the first few weeks of its life without a parent. He\
      \ was distraught. </p>\n<p>Luckily my professor/boss was like \u201CDon\u2019\
      t worry Mr. Brown, if you return the fawn relatively close to the spot that\
      \ you found it, the mother will come back. The human scent thing is just a myth.\
      \ The fawn will be alright, just be sure to keep the barn quiet so that the\
      \ fawn doesn\u2019t panic.\u201D </p>\n<p>Mr. Brown\u2019s face lit up and he\
      \ let out a sigh of relief. \u201CThank God\u201D he said \u201CI was so worried.\u201D\
      </p>\n<p>And that\u2019s the story of how I met the sweetest man ever: Mr. Jason\
      \ Brown.</p>"

  - reblog_content_raw: "<p>When my sister and I were kids we had this one action\
      \ figure, who was actually a brutalized batman doll without his cape (the dog\
      \ chewed half his head, too), who we dubbed\_\u2018Evil Chancellor Traytor\u2019\
      . The idea was that in the fictional society of our toys,\_\u2018chancellor\u2019\
      \ just came with the word\_\u2018evil\u2019 in front of it, as a matter of ancient\
      \ tradition. Like\_\u2018grand\u2019 or\_\u2018high\u2019 or something along\
      \ those lines.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the running gag was that the king (an old Power\
      \ Rangers knock-off doll) had absolute and unwavering faith in Evil Chancellor\
      \ Traytor, who basically comported himself like a mix between Grima Wormtongue\
      \ and Jafar from the Aladdin movies. Everyone was always sure that Evil Chancellor\
      \ Traytor had something to do with the nefarious scheme of the day. The dude\
      \ even carried around a poisoned knife called\_\u2018the kingslayer\u2019.</p>\n\
      <p>The additional twist on the joke, though, was that he <i>never was</i>\_\
      behind anything. The king was actually right. Evil Chancellor Traytor was the\
      \ most devoted civil servant in the entire Action Figure Dystopia. He spent\
      \ his nights working on writing up new legislature to ensure that broken toys\
      \ had access to mobility devices, was always on the lookout to acquire new shoeboxes\
      \ for expanding city infrastructure, and drafted a proposal that once got half\
      \ the\_\u2018settlement\u2019 in my sister and I\u2019s closet moved to the\
      \ upper shelf so that vulnerable toys were less likely to be snatched up by\
      \ the dog.</p>\n<p>The knife, as it turned out, was as symbolic as the\_\u2018\
      evil\u2019 in his name. See, Action Figure Dystopia had a long history of corrupted\
      \ monarchs getting too big for their thrones and exploiting the underclasses.\
      \ The job of the Evil Chancellor was to always remain vigilant, and loyally\
      \ serve a good ruler - or, if the regent should became a despot, to slay them\
      \ on behalf of the people.</p>\n<p>But since killing the king would be a terrible\
      \ crime, the Evil Chancellor had to be the kind of person who would willingly\
      \ die to spare the people from the plight of a wicked leader; because the murder\
      \ would be pinned on them, in order to keep the\_\u2018machinery of politics\u2019\
      \ working as smoothly as ever.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Evil Chancellor Traytor had a\
      \ diary, in which my sister I would take turns writing out the most over-the-top\
      \ good shit he\u2019d done behind the scenes. Usually after everyone else had\
      \ finished talking shit about him. I don\u2019t know why but we got the biggest\
      \ kick out of being like:</p>\n<p>Barbie With the Unfortunate Haircut: Oh that\
      \ Evil Chancellor Traytor! Why can\u2019t the king see how wicked he is?!</p>\n\
      <p>Charmander From the Vending Machine: Char!</p>\n<p>Jurassic Park Toy of Jeff\
      \ Goldblum With Disturbingly Realistic Face: At least if someone puts a knife\
      \ in the king\u2019s back, <i>we\u2019ll</i>\_know where to look!</p>\n<p>Evil\
      \ Chancellor Traytor\u2019s Diary: Today I was feeding ducks at the park when\
      \ I noticed another legless action figure sitting by the benches. I put a hundred\
      \ dollars into his bag while he wasn\u2019t looking. I really need to increase\
      \ budgeting to the medical treatment centers. If only we had enough glue, I\
      \ think we would see far fewer toys trying to get by without limbs\u2026 *insert\
      \ iconic evil laugh*</p>\n<p>Anyway, Evil Chancellor Traytor eventually fell\
      \ victim to one of my mom\u2019s cleaning sprees, and she decided he was too\
      \ busted up to keep and tossed him out. My littler brother, who tended to follow\
      \ my sister and I\u2019s games like he was watching a daily soap opera, cried\
      \ so hard that we had to do a special\_\u2018episode\u2019 where one of the\
      \ toys found the Evil Chancellor\u2019s diary, and so he got a big huge memorial\
      \ and the king threw himself into the empty grave and then ordered the toys\
      \ driving the toy bulldozer to bury him so that\_\u2018Traytor\u2019s grave\
      \ would have a body\u2019 (this seemed very important for some reason).</p>\n\
      <p>And then we had the Quest For a New King. Somehow or another that ended up\
      \ being a giant rubber snake called\_\u2018Tyrant King Cobra\u2019.</p>"

      \ are called \u201Cwalk through observations\u201D. Basically, this means that\
      \ 4 times a year the principal or vice principal comes into my class to assess\
      \ my teaching. Fine. Sure. No problem.<br>\nWell, today I was doing an activity\
      \ with my 1st graders called \u201CMusical Groceries\u201D. Basically, they\
      \ make up a fake shopping list and then together we figure out what the rhythm\
      \ of the words on the list is. To do that, a small group of students plays the\
      \ beat on the conga drum while the rest of the students move around the room\
      \ while chanting the word. It sounds weird but it\u2019s a great way for the\
      \ kids to figure out the relationship between syllables and rhythm.<br>\nThey\
      \ quickly get bored of walking the rhythm so I let them come up with their own\
      \ ways of moving around the room.( skipping, hopping, etc) One student suggested\
      \ they hop around the room like frogs, way down low to the ground. Okay fine.<br>\n\
      Or it was fine until my vice principal walked in to do my observation only to\
      \ find 20 seven year olds hopping around the room like a hoard of little hob-goblins,\
      \ rhythmically chanting \u201CBREAD! BREAD! BREAD!\u201D while five other kids\
      \ played ominous beats  in a drum circle.<br>\nI have never seen anyone look\

      Everyone knows the story, right? His protected workers? \_How none of his ammo\

      <p>He wasn\u2019t a saint. in fact, he was a bit of a douche, all things considered.\
      \ Whored around on his wife, worked for the Abwehr, he was a member of the nazi\
      \ party - not a particularly devout follower, but because he was a big fat remora\
      \ fish who realised this particular shark could give him business opportunities,\
      \ and if he wined and dined the upper crust that scored him even better ones.\
      \ \_He realised very quickly he could make an absolute killing on the black\
      \ market and dove in headfirst with the profiteering. \_Hell, he initially hired\
      \ Jews in his factory because nazi strictures made them much much cheaper labour\
      \ than hiring normal Polish labourers. \_</p>\n<p>But the thing is, once you\
      \ start surrounding yourself with a particular, persecuted demographic, you\
      \ begin to notice things. \_You hear things, things you aren\u2019t insulated\
      \ from. \_You begin to realise something.<br></p>\n<p>And Oskar Schindler began\
      \ to dimly grasp what was happening and he realised that it was not something\
      \ he could countenance. \_And his whole gameplay changed.<br><br>He no longer\
      \ wined and dined for business opportunities, but to protect his workers. \_\
      He went flat out fucking balls to the wall to rescue a group of his workers\
      \ from the jaws of Auschwitz, and built them a\_\u201Ccamp\u201D that offered\
      \ at least the barest of human comforts, right under SS supervision. \_He moved\
      \ his <i>entire fucking factory</i>\_to save his workers, he realised an SS-provided\
      \ list of names was left with blank spaces and just started filling in more.\
      \ \_He blew everything he had made profiteering and scheming to protect 1200\
      \ people because he found that there was a fucking line and it had to be drawn.\
      \ He arranged for three thousand Jewish women to be moved to textile factories\
      \ in the Sudetenland to give them a chance of surviving the war. \_ He blew\
      \ all his money, resources and time on feeding, caring for and trying to protect\
      \ as many Jews as he could.<br><br></p>\n<p>After the war he failed every business\
      \ venture he tried. \_He became a raging alcoholic, surviving on donations sent\
      \ by <i>Schindlerjuden. </i>\_According to some, he traded the ring gifted to\
      \ him by his workers for Schnapps. \_He died in relative obscurity, almost penniless.<br></p>\n\
      <p><br>He wasn\u2019t a great man, or a saint. He was an average schmuck, and\
      \ spent most of his time fucking around until he abruptly found himself in a\
      \ situation where he <i>couldn\u2019t</i>. \_He almost stumbled into his decency.\

      because of him\_<b>8,500 people are alive today.</b></p>\n<p><b><br></b>Never,\

      \ dog\u2019s name was John. they found him half drowned in a bag of puppies\
      \ that were not so fortunate as he was, and was taken in immediately. he was\
      \ a runt and not quite right (most likely from the whole half drowned thing),\
      \ but a very loving dog. the problem with John was that <i>he smelled like death</i>,\
      \ and no one knew why. vets couldn\u2019t figure it out. it was obviously some\
      \ kind of skin problem, but they had no idea what kind. all anyone knew was\
      \ that if you touched him, you would smell like death too, so you couldn\u2019\
      t pet him, and that for some reason, the <i>only thing</i>\_that made the smell\
      \ go away was being around other dogs. so they got another dog and the death\
      \ smell stopped and John lived a very happy life</p>\n<p>when he was getting\
      \ old, maybe about 15 years, part of his skull caved in. just like that! suddenly\
      \ had a huge dent in his head! and he was totally fine. didn\u2019t notice it,\
      \ didn\u2019t affect him at all. just this massive dent right there in his head\
      \ where his skull had collapsed in on his brain, and he was still the happiest\
      \ and most loving dog. the skull cave in, for whatever reason, caused the ear\
      \ on that side of his head to just fall off entirely, but again, perfectly happy\
      \ dog who did not know he was down an ear and a fully formed skull. they took\
      \ him to the vet, thinking maybe they should put him down. I mean, wouldn\u2019\
      t you think so? but the vet said that the dog was eating, and pooping, and happy,\
      \ so there was no reason to put him down, so they didn\u2019t</p>\n<p>but that\u2019\
      s not even the weird part. the weird part is the area of the brain that got\
      \ caved in on was apparently the area that registers pain, so this one-eared,\
      \ collapsed skull dog could no longer feel <i>any</i>\_pain. he got old, his\
      \ joints got stiff, his teeth rotted out of his head, his tongue hung out of\
      \ his mouth and got black and hard, and he felt none of it! in fact, he was\
      \ happier than he\u2019d ever been feeling no pain, and the fact that he didn\u2019\
      t feel how much he was falling apart somehow made him live until he was <i><b>23</b></i>.\
      \ that\u2019s right, the collapsed skull, one eared, zero teeth, smells like\
      \ literal death when alone dog lived to be <b><i>23</i>\_</b>years old. they\
      \ used to joke that he\u2019d been dead for years, but was too stupid to realize\
      \ it yet</p>\n<p>and that\u2019s the story about the <i>literal zombie dog</i>\

      \ class=\"tumblr_blog\" target=\"_blank\">castiel-knight-of-hell</a>:</p>\n\n\
      \n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a very good question and thank you for asking so politely.\_\
      </p>\n<p>The word feminism was coined by Charles Fourier in 1837, a French philosopher\
      \ who advocated for the emancipation of women because he believed society treated\
      \ women as slaves. We weren\u2019t allowed to vote, own anything, or work a\
      \ real job. Women were ruled by their fathers/household patriarch until they\
      \ married at which time they\u2019d be under the rule of their husband. If a\
      \ woman did not belong to male household she was shunned by society and had\
      \ very little means to make money, most of them unsavory. You know the idiom\_\
      \u201Crule of thumb\u201D? That comes from a running joke that started in the\
      \ 1600s, and was still around in Fourier\u2019s time, that said it was okay\
      \ for a man to beat a woman with a stick as long as it wasn\u2019t any thicker\
      \ than his thumb.\_</p>\n<p>The point of the word feminist, and the feminist\
      \ movement, has never been to say that women are better than men. The point\
      \ is that women and things associated with women have been given a lesser place\
      \ in society and we want to bring those things up to a place of equality. The\
      \ focus is on the feminine because that\u2019s what\u2019s being pushed down.\
      \ However, focusing on the feminine does not mean we\u2019re focusing only women.\
      \ Men are belittled and called\_\u201Cless of a man\u201D anytime they portray\
      \ a trait that is associated with femininity. If women and the feminine were\
      \ equal to men and masculinity then that wouldn\u2019t happen. Feminism is about\
      \ raising up things associated with females to have an equal place in society\
      \ as the things associated with males. It\u2019s called feminism, not equalism,\
      \ because the focus is on raising up not tearing down. Equalism would suggest\
      \ that male things need to come down to a lower level so that female things\
      \ can meet it in the middle. That\u2019s not the point. The point is to raise\
      \ up the feminine so that it\u2019s on the same playing field that the masculine\
      \ is already on. <b>We don\u2019t want men to lower themselves, we just want\
      \ them to make room for us.</b></p>"

      \ is an infamous building on our campus, called\_\u201CMontgomery House\u201D\
      \ or more commonly,\_\u201CMonty.\u201D Monty is the building for animation,\
      \ game design, special effects, sound design, and basically everything that\
      \ requires highly powerful, highly specialized computers and software. The building\
      \ is infamous for a couple of reasons. It\u2019s located pretty far away from\
      \ any other building, for one. \n\nThe building itself used to be a coffin factory,\
      \ no joke. \_Another is the building has no windows. None. There are also no\
      \ clocks anywhere. Once you enter Monty, you are completely separated from the\
      \ flow of time and the light of day. \_Probably the reason Monty is most known\
      \ though is because students in the\_\u201Cmonty majors\u201D have to spend\
      \ a lot of time there. A lot. It is not uncommon for somebody to spend more\
      \ than a few days exclusively within the sunless, dark walls of Monty. If you\
      \ go to the building, it is not surprising to see students sleeping on the floor,\
      \ on the few chairs available, on the computers. Some bring sleeping bags and\
      \ rations. Some just forgo sleep, buy espresso shots and work. The entire building\
      \ just smells of coffee and sweat. It really seems like an exageration, but\
      \ its not hyperbole.\_</p>\n<p>Why I bring this up is because of something that\u2019\
      s started recenetly. Inside the building, the school has hung up artwork on\
      \ the walls from other majors as is typical on campus. One of the artworks was\
      \ a self-portrait painting of a man with long, scraggly brown hair and a full\
      \ beard looking pensively off into the distance. The painting became known as\_\
      \u201CMonty Jesus.\u201D</p>\n<p>Students, in their desperation for their files\
      \ to render, or the computers to work, began to offer prayers to Monty Jesus.\
      \ Soon, they began writing their prayers and taping them next to the painting.\
      \ The wall is now covered, completly plastered, in prayers to Monty Jesus for\
      \ things like\_\u201CFix the wifi\u201D and\_\u201Clet me live through finals\u201D\
      \ and more simply\_\u201Chelp me.\u201D Candles have been added. Literal candles\
      \ are placed around Monty Jesus in hopes he will help them.</p>\n<p>This is\
      \ how religions are born. Monty Jesus is considered a\_\u201Cjoke\u201D, but\
      \ people at Monty still hold\u2026. quite a lot of superstitious faith in the\
      \ concept. There is even talk of a\_\u201CMonty Satan\u201D that creates software\
      \ failures. It might be in jest, but these students really are hoping for some\
      \ force to help them. And they\u2019ve given it a name, an image, and respect.\
      \ \_Monty Jesus is real, and I\u2019m sure of it. The desperate students have\
      \ created their own spirit and their own form of worship, out of need.</p>\n\
      <p>Religion, spirituality, didn\u2019t stop being relevant. It didn\u2019t stop\
      \ being something people need and want, and have the desire to create. It\u2019\
      s still happening, and it always will as long as their are people. \_The spirit\
      \ of creation, new deities and new worship, is alive and well today and should\
      \ not be ignored simply because it is\_\u201Cnew\u201D or\_\u201Ca joke.\u201D\

      <p>I work at a concession stand in an ice rink. We sell a bunch of chocolate\
      \ bars and snacks and shit including Kinder Surprise eggs.</p>\n<p>So one day\
      \ this woman comes up to the counter with her two little kids, a girl who\u2019\
      s probably about 6 or 7 and a little boy, maybe 3 or 4. The mom asks what they\
      \ want, the little girl points at the Kinder eggs and says \u201COne of those!\u201D\
      . I asked if she wanted the white or the pink egg. She said pink. The little\
      \ boy pointed to the Kinder eggs and says \u201COne of those!\u201D. I asked\
      \ if he wanted the white or the pink egg. He said pink. HOLY SHIT IT WAS LIKE\
      \ I OPENED THE GATES OF HELL. The mom absolutely FLIPPED and was like \u201C\
      YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE PINK EGG IT\u2019S ONLY FOR GIRLS. YOU CAN GET THE WHITE\
      \ ONE OR NOTHING AT ALL\u201D. The little boy looked at his mom and said \u201C\
      But I want the same as ______ (whatever the sister\u2019s name was)\u201D. The\
      \ mom completely ignored him and turned to me and gave me a death glare. \u201C\
      He can have the white egg.\u201D</p>\n<p>I had to give a little boy a white\
      \ egg when he wanted the pink so that he could be the same as his big sister\
      \ and he started crying. The mom just reiterated that the pink egg was for girls\
      \ and told him that boys don\u2019t cry.</p>\n<p>And this is why we shouldn\u2019\
      t gender fucking chocolate eggs.</p>"

      \ nearly lost my shit. I did temporarily lose my customer service face and ask\

      \ scan her food items would give her radiation poisoning. they tried to explain\

      <p>the employees had to punch in every. last. grocery. item. MANUALLY. </p>\n\

      \ class today. It\u2019s hilarious and goes a bit like this</p>\n\n<p>In 1989,\
      \ President Bush sent troops to Panama to capture the dictator and drug lord,\
      \ Manuel Noriega. But Noriega had fled to (I had to look up the full name) the\
      \ Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See. The troops couldn\u2019t exactly get\
      \ in, so they surrounded the place and has to wait him out, or somehow force\
      \ him out.<br>\nAnd it\u2019s crazy how they did it.<br>\nThe literal United\
      \ States Navy SEALs did this <br>\nAnd it is real history</p>\n\n<p>They blasted\
      \ rock and roll music for days until he gave up</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, Noriega\
      \ only liked opera, so this annoyed him. <br>\nBut it gets better.<br>\nThe\
      \ playlist was not only obnoxiously loud and obnoxiously American, it had a\
      \ sense of irony.<br>\nHere are some highlights:</p>\n\n<p>Danger Zone<br>\n\
      Freedom Fighter<br>\nGonna Tear Your Playhouse Down<br>\nGive It Up<br>\nI Fought\
      \ the Law and the Law Won<br>\nIf I Had a Rocket Launcher<br>\nNowhere to Run<br>\n\

      Stay Hungry<br>\nThey\u2019re Coming to Take Me Away<br>\nThis Means War<br>\n\
      Wanted Dead or Alive</p>\n\n<p>And my personal favorite, and a thing that actually\
      \ happened:<br>\nNever Gonna Give You Up</p>\n\n<p>I just\u2026<br>\nImagine\
      \ the board meeting<br>\n\u201CHuh, how are we going to force this guy out of\
      \ hiding?\u201D<br>\n\u201COh, I have an idea! Why don\u2019t we blast loud\
      \ rock music?\u201D<br>\n\u201CThat just might work! And we should do it with\
      \ a sense of irony, just to make it funnier!\u201D</p>"

      \ a sparkly white rock that will look like a diamond to the untrained eye and\
      \ will literally cost the price of a nice dinner for two? Created white sapphire.\
      \ They\u2019re lab grown and cost *pennies* to make, so you can get a 1 or 2\
      \ carat white sapphire for like\u2026 $30-80 probably. You can get one as huge\
      \ as you like, perfectly clear, perfectly flawless. And no one will ever be\
      \ able to tell the difference except a professional appraiser. Also, sapphires\
      \ are the second-hardest gemstone (right after diamonds) so they are very durable!\
      \ Very unlikely that they\u2019ll chip or crack. Get that bitch set in sterling\
      \ silver and you are GOOD TO GO. Whole thing should cost you less than $200\
      \ unless you get a fancy band with a lot of extra stones. Of course, created\
      \ sapphires come in every color of the rainbow, so if you want something more\
      \ exciting than plain white, you TOTALLY CAN.\_</p>\n<p>Created sapphires and\

      \n<p>Education can either promote diversity or promote division, it can either\

      \ prepare kids to participate fully and fairly in the economy or be left out\

      \ forward to things improving, we are looking forward to things getting worse.\
      \ </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s ironic that, at least under Obama and when HRC was Secretary\
      \ of State, the US was funding and helping other countries reform their public\
      \ education system and help girls get educated, get poor kids into school and\
      \ stay in school, improve teacher development, get unskilled people get skilled\
      \ so they\u2019ll become not just financially self sufficient but also be valuable\
      \ human capital for their economy, make peace building and religious tolerance\
      \ to be part of their curriculum, get private sector to invest in their communities\
      \ not just take advantage of them, have apprenticeships and mentorship programs,\
      \ invest in early childhood education, etc etc, but now we are actually trying\
      \ to prevent our own kids from having those advantages in our education system.</p>"

  - reblog_content_raw: "<p>Today is Autistics Speaking Day. I have something to say\
      \ to non-autistic people. Can you listen?</p>\n<hr><p>Marvin and I went out\
      \ to eat after protesting the 2014 Autism Speaks walk with ASAN Vancouver. From\
      \ the moment we entered the restaurant, a patron sitting and eating with her\
      \ family was openly staring at me and my wheelchair.</p>\n<p>It seemed like\
      \ this person really had a problem with me when I got out of my wheelchair to\
      \ fold it up and sit at the only place we could- \_the table right next to her\
      \ and her family. The staring got really obvious then. When Marvin brought over\
      \ our food and McStaringson saw that we were going to stay and eat there, she\
      \ got very uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>I was tired, 110% finished with non-autistics,\
      \ hungry, and overloaded in all of my senses. In that moment I cared a sub-zero\
      \ amount about looking non-autistic, or less obviously disabled. I just did\
      \ my thing and ignored McStaringson. I made no eye contact with anyone. I didn\u2019\
      t force any facial expressions. I was rocking in my seat, and I very likely\
      \ flapped my hands when I saw our food coming.</p>\n<p>When she couldn\u2019\
      t take it anymore (and she didn\u2019t last long) McStaringson leaned over and\
      \ pointed me out to her family. From the table immediately next to us. She was\
      \ upset. I could hear her very clearly, but I\u2019m sure she wanted me to.\
      \ She actually managed to convince her teenage kids and spouse to get up and\
      \ leave their food, which none of them had finished, so that she could get away\
      \ from me as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>I never went back to that restaurant.\
      \ It took a little time and a lot of gritting my teeth to be able to eat in\
      \ public again.</p>\n<hr><p>I have tried to talk about this three times in the\
      \ presence of non-autistic people. All three times I was met with disbelief,\
      \ justification, or correction- as if I were wrong about the thing that happened\
      \ to me. Perhaps you\u2019re feeling bristly and defensive yourself. Perhaps\
      \ you\u2019re already composing a #NotAllAllistics response like the ones I\
      \ have heard in real space.</p>\n<p>\u201CIt couldn\u2019t have been that bad.\u201D\
      </p>\n<p>\u201CI\u2019m sure you misunderstood.\u201D</p>\n<p>\u201CMaybe she\
      \ was leaving for some other reason.\u201D</p>\n<p>\u201CWell, don\u2019t autistic\
      \ people struggle with understanding facial expressions\u2026?\u201D</p>\n<p>They\
      \ spoke for me, over me. They were so unwilling to hear what I was saying or\
      \ believe that ableism is a widespread problem to which everyone is owed some\
      \ responsibility, that they denied reality and my experiences.</p>\n<p>And yet,\
      \ this is the same kind of person who expresses dismayed surprise when they\
      \ are finally confronted with an act of violent ableism or obvious oppression\
      \ that they can\u2019t deny. The denial of our daily lived experiences is the\
      \ foundation for more obvious forms of oppression, but they can\u2019t see the\
      \ link. That link needs to be pointed out and the silencing needs to stop.</p>\n\
      <p>It\u2019s not so much that autistic people aren\u2019t speaking. We are speaking.\
      \ It\u2019s that so few are listening, and the rest of you won\u2019t stop speaking\
      \ over us. Our voices get drowned out. Often this is intentional. Sometimes\
      \ it is the result of a true ignorance about autistic people and our lives,\
      \ or the wrong belief that autistic people need someone to speak for them. But\
      \ allies can help fight this ignorance and slay that insidious lie.</p>\n<p>When\
      \ an autistic person shares their lived experiences, believe and support them.\
      \ When we have something to say, listen. Value our knowledge. Share our words\
      \ so they fly farther. Amplify our voices, no matter how we communicate. I would\
      \ say that the Autistics Speaking Day hashtags are an excellent place to start.</p>\n\

      \ experience. Before the surgery wasn\u2019t too interesting but as soon as\
      \ I woke up I saw the nurse next to me and was all like \u201Chey\u2026 i think\u2026\
      \ i died\u2026 and now I\u2019m in a parallel universe\u2026 and i gotta go\
      \ back to my house and kill the me from this universe\u201D and he was just\
      \ kinda like \u201Calright, you do that\u201D. And then the other nurse kept\
      \ going in and out of the room to get things and I thought there was like 5\
      \ of her that kept coming out of the room, and then so when she was wheeling\
      \ me out in a wheelchair I was like \u201Cdamn\u2026 why are there so many of\
      \ you\u2026 there\u2019s like 5 many of you\u201D and she was just kinda like\
      \ \u201Calright, you do that\u201D.</p>\n<p>Anyway I got to the car and my dad\
      \ was there and he was like \u201Chow ya feeling son\u201D in the dadliest way\
      \ possible and I was like \u201CMAN I AM PUMPED LETS GET SOME JUICE I\u2019\
      M STARVED\u201D so we drove about 3 blocks to a jamba juice, whereupon I say\
      \ \u201CI\u2019m good I can do this\u201D and run/drunkstumble 30 feet to the\
      \ door. I burst in the door like a viking returning from some fucking battle\
      \ and holler \u201CWHATS UP FUCKS\u201D to everyone in the store, which was\
      \ thankfully just the 2 people behind the counter, who looked probably as scared/confused\
      \ as a jamba juice employee could look.</p>\n<p>So anyway, as my dad explained\
      \ the situation I looked up at the jamba juice menu and was utterly fucking\
      \ lost in it. Like I swear I was looking at this menu board for a year, deciphering\
      \ this Rosetta stone of fruits. I distinctly remember that I was looking at\
      \ each item in a smoothie, thinking of how it tasted, then moving on to the\
      \ next thing and thinking of how\_<i>that\_</i>tasted, and how they would taste\
      \ together. Since most smoothies had 3 or 4 items, this took some thinking.\
      \ So my dad sees me in this extreme brain blast state of mind and says \u201C\
      hey are you going to order or what\u201D. Keep in mind I\u2019m on the first\
      \ fucking smoothie on the list here. So I just say \u201Cshush man I\u2019m\
      \ trying to do fruit science\u201D, and then when I realized that this process\
      \ could take literal years, I just said \u201Cyeah give me a smooth regular\u201D\
      \ which for the uninitiated, isn\u2019t actually a real thing on any menu.\_\
      Oh, also I asked them if the \u201Cboosted\u201D smoothies would give me super\
      \ powers and then pointed my fingers at them and made \u201Clightning noises\u201D\
      .</p>\n<p>So my dad just orders me the first thing on the menu and I go to sit\
      \ down and stare out the window or some shit and my thoroughly amused dad just\
      \ looks at me and says \u201Chow ya feelin?\u201D. Now at this time I was feeling\
      \ a lot of things, but most noticeable to me was the gauze in my mouth, so I\
      \ just look at him and say \u201Cthere\u2019s these fuckin\u2026 tiny sheep\
      \ in my head\u201D which at the time was the best way I had to convey this feeling.\
      \ Anyway about that time, the jamba juice guy brings us our drinks and he gives\
      \ me a small thing of mario kart stickers and I swear I almost cried from the\
      \ tsunami of emotion that gift made me feel (I still have them).</p>\n<p>Anyway\
      \ the rest of the story is we drove home and I explained this programming project\
      \ I was working on to my dad in perfect detail somehow and then I came home\
      \ and went on facebook and posted a comment on my friends status (because I\
      \ couldn\u2019t find the status update bar) that read: \u201Ci just took a lort\
      \ of painkillers and yelled at everyone in a jambo juice\u201D</p>"

      \ fun family game called \u201Cmaybe you want to put jesus in your room instead,\
      \ sweetie? :)\u201D. now, it\u2019s important to note that the jesus referred\
      \ to in our game is not actually the real jesus christ, but instead a wooden\
      \ figure i made in 2011 that has an uncanny resemblance to the lord and savior\
      \ himself</p>\n<p>so what happens is that i place jesus in our living room,\
      \ and my grandma smiles and asks me if i don\u2019t want to decorate my room\
      \ with him instead. i ask her in return if she thinks my jesus figure is ugly\
      \ (which he is), but she reassures me that this is not the case. however, a\
      \ couple of days later jesus mysteriously disappears from our living room, and\
      \ appear in my room instead</p>\n<p>now, the real jesus christ might have been\
      \ able to perform a miracle like this, but please remember that the jesus in\
      \ our story is only a figure made out of wood. he can not move on his own, so\
      \ i think we can safely say that my grandma is the prime suspect here</p>\n\
      <p>the first year i would often confront my grandma about this, but she would\
      \ always make up an excuse and never straight up tell me she moved him because\
      \ he\u2019s so ugly it\u2019s an embarrassment to the family</p>\n<p>eventually\
      \ i grew tired of her lies, so now we only move jesus around in silence. one\
      \ second he\u2019s in the living room, the next he\u2019s back in my room. in\
      \ a way i think this adds an extra element of excitement to the holiday season,\
      \ because you never know for sure when jesus is going to be moved again</p>"

      \ cool I\u2019ll give her that,) because he was rude to her and didn\u2019t\

      \ in the class used the word \u201Cbungalow\u201D as often as possible and every\
      \ time he needed to say \u201Chouse\u201D or \u201Chome\u201D he swapped it\
      \ for \u201Cbungalow\u201D and me and the rest of the class thought it was so\
      \ fucking funny. </p>\n\n<p>so everyone in the class started using it too like\
      \ saying \u201CI brought my lunch from the bungalow today\u201D or whatever\
      \ and the teachers HATED IT.</p>\n\n<p>it started getting out of hand when we\
      \ were learning about the presidents and we often needed to say \u201Cthe White\
      \ House\u201D so of course we would say \u201Cthe White Bungalow\u201D and the\
      \ teacher was so furious and then there was a ban on the word and if anyone\
      \ said it they were sent to the office and I remember the kid who started all\
      \ the bullshit one time got in trouble for something petty like sharing his\
      \ homework and the teacher said that she was going to call home to him mom and\
      \ he just stood up and cried out \u201CNo, ms_____! Please don\u2019t call home!\u201D\
      </p>\n\n<p>and there was this huge silence because he just raised his voice\
      \ at the teacher</p>\n\n<p>and then a huge smile spread across his face and\
      \ he said</p>\n\n<p>\u201Ccall bungalow instead.\u201D</p>\n\n<p>and I swear\

      \ the media never portrayed these kinds of housing arrangements. As far as i\
      \ was concerned, I just had an extra non-blood parent.</p>\n<p>According to\
      \ my parents, it was very common in the 70\u2032s-80\u2032s to buy houses with\
      \ your friends, because it was financially smart to do so (so long as you were\
      \ certain they were close friends who wouldn\u2019t fall out with you and fuck\
      \ everything up). Houses and house payments are much more manageable when you\
      \ split the bills 3-4 ways instead of just two.</p>\n<p>Millenials aren\u2019\
      t the first to think it\u2019s a great idea to just shack up with friends. That\u2019\
      s housemating without the hastle of living with strangers. It\u2019s still a\
      \ good idea to shack up with people you\u2019ve known a long time so you know\
      \ how you\u2019ll get on living together, but still. In the current economy,\
      \ it\u2019s pretty much now our only option for affording anything.</p>\n<p>I\
      \ think, and I\u2019m not researched on this, but I think conservatives probably\
      \ tried to suppress images of non-nuclear families because they likely thought\
      \ it would encourage ideas of polygamy, polyamory, open sexual relationships\
      \ with or without marriage, as well as other relationship types they thought\
      \ of as un-christian or unsavoury. I could be wrong, but that shit wouldn\u2019\
      t surprise me.</p>\n<p>(And i want to make a note that there\u2019s also a disturbing\
      \ amount of asexual denial around that makes people go\_\u2018if they\u2019\
      re living together they HAVE to be banging because why wouldn\u2019t they?\u2019\
      \ and that shit both creeps me out and annoys me no end. People can be in relationships\
      \ without sex. People can live together without sex. Sex is not the be-all and\
      \ end-all and people being taught to think it is really need to stop).</p>\n\
      <p>Don\u2019t let the media fool you into believing you can only live with a\
      \ sexual partner or blood family. Someone somewhere has an agenda for making\
      \ these seem abnormal, when really it\u2019s just practical.</p>"

      \ a metaphor for homosexuality/bisexuality and here\u2019s why:<br></p>\n<ul><li>in\
      \ the song, dancing (stereotypically associated with women and gay men) represents\
      \ same-gender attraction and the more\_\u201Cmasculine\u201D sport, baseball,\
      \ represents heterosexuality. Ryan tells chad\_\u201CI\u2019ll show you that\
      \ it\u2019s one and the same\u201D - that being gay is as valid as being straight,\
      \ and that it is nothing to be ashamed of. ryan is clearly proud of being able\
      \ to dance</li>\n<li>Ryan encourages chad to \u201Cswing like him\u201D, bearing\
      \ in mind ryan is strongly implied to be gay and the word swing is often used\
      \ with regards to sexuality, ie\_\u201CI don\u2019t swing that way\u201D</li>\n\
      <li>Chad displays a stereotypical masculine bravado, he is clearly trying to\
      \ impress Ryan, he tells him \u201CI\u2019ve got what it takes\u2026 so you\
      \ better spin that pitch you\u2019re gonna throw me\u201D, while reasserting\
      \ his definite heterosexuality, he adds\_\u201CI\u2019ll show you how I swing\u201D\
      </li>\n<li>Chad also implies that he experiences gay feelings but represses\
      \ them. When ryan tells him\_\u201CYou\u2019ll never know if you never try\u201D\
      , chad replies\_\u201Cthere\u2019s just one thing that stops me every time\u201D\
      . this shows his fear of social rejection and his own internalised homophobia</li>\n\
      <li>as the song progresses this becomes more obvious, chad goes from saying\
      \ he\_\u201Cdoesn\u2019t\u201D dance to saying he\_\u201Ccan\u2019t\u201D even\
      \ though it is clear that he is actually a good dancer while also being skilled\
      \ at baseball</li>\n<li>from this we can guess that chad is bisexual and that\
      \ ryan is either bisexual or gay, though we can assume his preference lies with\
      \ men at this point</li>\n<li>on top of this there is the obvious underlying\
      \ sexual tension running throughout the song. they switch between confrontational\
      \ and flirty; there\u2019s a lot of smiling and eyebrow waggling going on, and\
      \ when they do dance they get all up in each others personal space</li>\n<li>the\
      \ song ends with ryan falling on top of chad. in the following scene, they are\
      \ wearing each other\u2019s clothes</li>\n</ul><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"\

      \ that he\n is willing to completely undermine the core values of a free country\
      \ in\n order to impose his own vision of theocratic control.</p>\n<p>While\n\
      \ Donald Trump is a bumbling political idiot, Mike Pence is actively \nagainst\
      \ the people and possibilities that we need to help America to \nhave a strong\
      \ future. His career has been built on hateful exclusion, \nnot intelligent\
      \ inclusion.</p>\n<p>Here are some things that every voter should know about\
      \ Mike Pence:</p>\n<p>- Science and invention helped build America, but <b>Mike\
      \ Pence is 100% anti-science.</b>\n He chooses not to accept the preponderance\
      \ of evidence that supports \nanthropomorphic climate change, and he thinks\
      \ schools should be required\n to teach Christian \u201Ccreationism\u201D mythology\
      \ alongside evolution in \nscience classrooms.</p>\n<p>- <b>Mike Pence is anti-environment.</b>\n\
      \ As governor, he has vetoed every piece of environmental regulation that\n\
      \ has crossed his desk. He doesn\u2019t want the EPA to regulate greenhouse\
      \ \ngases, and he does want to open up pretty much every part of our country\n\
      \ to oil and coal companies. No more wildlands under Pence. He is one of \n\
      those irresponsible extremists who think that God gave us the world so \nwe\
      \ could just use it up, and when it is all used up the second coming \nwill\
      \ occur. There is no Biblical basis for this belief.</p>\n<p>- Females make\
      \ up more than half of the American population, but <b>Mike Pence is anti-woman.</b>\n\
      \ He has said the Disney movie \u201CMulan,\u201D which was based on a centuries\
      \ \nold Chinese poem, was the work of a \u201Cmischievous liberal\u201D trying\
      \ to \ngroom young children to accept women in combat. \u201CDespite her delicate\
      \ \nfeatures and voice, Disney expects us to believe that Mulan\u2019s ingenuity\
      \ \nand courage were enough to carry her to military success on an equal \n\
      basis,\u201D he wrote on his radio show\u2019s website.</p>\n<p>- <b>He obsessively\
      \ pursues a personal vendetta to take Title X funding\n away from Planned Parenthood</b>\
      \ because Planned Parenthood provides \nabortion services. Title X money CANNOT\
      \ be used for abortions. Abortions\n are paid for by the recipient or through\
      \ private, tagged donations. \nTaking away Title X will not impact abortion\
      \ services, but it would \nleave thousands of women without access to cancer\
      \ screenings or birth \ncontrol. <br></p>\n<p>- Speaking of birth control, <b>Mike\
      \ Pence once again revealed his historical ignorance in saying that condoms\
      \ are \u201Cmodern\u201D and \u201Cliberal.\u201D</b> \n He thinks all women\
      \ should be pregnant unless they can\u2019t afford a baby,\n in which case they\
      \ should abstain from sex, even if they are married. \nThat\u2019s right: sex\
      \ is only for procreation in PenceWorld. If you can\u2019t \nafford the diapers,\
      \ then hubby should be sleeping on the couch.</p>\n<p>- <b>Mike Pence is also\
      \ anti-gay</b>,\n to the point of denial. He doesn\u2019t want the government\
      \ to pay for \ncancer screenings, but he does want the government to pay for\
      \ abusive \n\u201Cconversion therapy\u201D programs that systematically undermine\
      \ the victim\u2019s\n self-esteem, and then indoctrinate them into robotic gender-appropriate\n\
      \ behaviors. He has signed into law a bill that allows discrimination \nagainst\
      \ LGTBQ customers based on religious belief.</p>\n<p>- As governor of Indiana,\
      \ <b>Mike Pence was personally responsible for an outbreak of AIDS</b> when\
      \ he refused to allow clean needle exchanges for drug addicts. Instead, he asked\
      \ people to pray for the addicts.</p>\n<p>- <b>Mike Pence is racist.</b>\n He\
      \ thinks there is \u201Ctoo much talk\u201D about institutional racism in law\
      \ \nenforcement because \u201Cpolice officers are human beings.\u201D His solution\
      \ is \nunity through \u201Cfaith.\u201D The Indiana governor has tried to prevent\
      \ Syrian \nrefugees from settling in his state because the \u201Cpose a threat\
      \ to safety\n of residents.\u201D Pence argued that his policy was based on\
      \ fear, not \nrace, so it wasn\u2019t discriminatory. A Federal Appeals Court\
      \ dismissed his\n racist arguments on October 3, 2016.</p>\n<p>- <b>A Federal\
      \ Court also had to block his bizarre anti-abortion law</b>\n that required\
      \ burial or cremation for fetuses, whether miscarried or \naborted, no matter\
      \ how far along the pregnancy had progressed. <br></p>\n<p>- <b>Mike Pence is\
      \ pro-birth, but not pro-life.</b>\n He once funneled $3.5M dollars from Temporary\
      \ Assistance to Needy \nFamilies into programs that counsel against abortion.\
      \ He wants those \nwomen to have those babies, but he doesn\u2019t care if the\
      \ kids starve or \nlive on the streets afterward.</p>\n<p>- <b>Mike Pence has\
      \ refused to comply with federal guidelines aimed at reducing prison rape.</b><br></p>\n\
      <p>When\n you add it all together, you can see that the most dangerous part\

      reality.<b><br></b></p>

      <p>Many of the people Planned Parenthood health centers serve may be concerned

      the face of threats made over the last several months.</p>

      <p>Health care should not be political. Every morning, Planned Parenthood health
      center staff across the country wake up and open their doors, as they have this
      morning, to care for anyone who needs them, regardless of race, religion, sexual
      orientation, gender, income, or country of origin. They will do so today, they
      will do so tomorrow, they will do so every day as they have for 100 years.<br></p>'

      \ is just a costume and doesn\u2019t offend natives, I was at a powwow yesterday\
      \ and one of the dancer\u2019s who was a war veteran accidentally dropped an\
      \ eagle feather while dancing and we had to stop the entire powwow, the head\
      \ man and some other elders had to stop and pray over the feather before picking\
      \ it up. The guy who dropped the father gave a speech, while almost in tears,\
      \ about how sorry he was to have dropped the feather and how it represented\
      \ the choices he had to make in combat and the lives of people that were taken,\
      \ and he ended up passing the feather on to another young dancer instead of\
      \ keeping it because he felt so ashamed. This is how much eagle feathers mean\
      \ to a lot of our nations, and that\u2019s how important it is to native veterans.\
      \ Wearing eagle feathers as a costume or without having to go through combat\
      \ is disgusting and you ARE offending our traditions and values. Stop. You cannot\

      \ the gist was that a friend of a friend lived in what was generally considered\
      \ a bad neighborhood, because he was a super poor college student and it was\
      \ what he could afford. He didn\u2019t have any furniture, he just slept on\
      \ a blanket on the floor and had a milk crate for a chair and like an old wire\
      \ spool as a table. No TV, nothing in the fridge, no microwave, basically just\
      \ bare walls and a roof to keep the weather off. So one day he comes home, and\
      \ there\u2019s a man in his apartment, just standing there, with this look of\
      \ utter amazement and horror on his face, and he turns to the guy who\u2019\
      s just entered and says, \u201CThis your place? \u2018cause I broke in to rob\
      \ you, but shit, man, you ain\u2019t got <i>nothin\u2019</i>. Wait here, I\u2019\
      m\u2019a be right back.\u201D And the burglar left, leaving a puzzled college\
      \ student alone in his empty apartment. But sure enough, the burglar came back\
      \ a while later, and brought some friends, and they delivered a table, a couple\
      \ of chairs, and a small TV. \u201CI think I got you a bed, too, but that might\
      \ take a couple days.\u201D</p>\n<p>So, the poor college student made some friends.\

      \ of red light, blue light, and green light. Our eyes do not have a sensor (cone\
      \ cell) for yellow light. So when we paint with light, red green and blue are\
      \ our primary colors. Because of our eyes.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, paint primary\
      \ colors are colors that cannot be created by mixing other colors together.\
      \ For paint, they are red yellow and blue, because you cannot mix orange and\
      \ green to get yellow. Mixing orange and purple paint does not make red. And\
      \ mixing green and purple paint does not make blue.</p>\n<p>Mixing blue and\
